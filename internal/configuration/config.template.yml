## Certificates directory specifies where Authelia will load trusted certificates (public portion) from in addition to
## the system certificates store.
## They should be in base64 format, and have one of the following extensions: *.cer, *.crt, *.pem.
# certificates_directory: /config/certificates

## The theme to display: light, dark, grey, auto.
theme: light

## The secret used to generate JWT tokens when validating user identity by email confirmation. JWT Secret can also be
## set using a secret: https://www.authelia.com/docs/configuration/secrets.html
jwt_secret: a_very_important_secret

## Default redirection URL
##
## If user tries to authenticate without any referer, Authelia does not know where to redirect the user to at the end
## of the authentication process. This parameter allows you to specify the default redirection URL Authelia will use
## in such a case.
##
## Note: this parameter is optional. If not provided, user won't be redirected upon successful authentication.
default_redirection_url: https://home.example.com/

##
## Server Configuration
##
server:

  ## The address to listen on.
  host: 0.0.0.0

  ## The port to listen on.
  port: 9091

  ## Set the single level path Authelia listens on.
  ## Must be alphanumeric chars and should not contain any slashes.
  path: ""

  ## Buffers usually should be configured to be the same value.
  ## Explanation at https://www.authelia.com/docs/configuration/server.html
  ## Read buffer size adjusts the server's max incoming request size in bytes.
  ## Write buffer size does the same for outgoing responses.
  read_buffer_size: 4096
  write_buffer_size: 4096

  ## Enables the pprof endpoint.
  enable_pprof: false

  ## Enables the expvars endpoint.
  enable_expvars: false

  ## Disables writing the health check vars to /app/.healthcheck.env which makes healthcheck.sh return exit code 0.
  ## This is disabled by default if either /app/.healthcheck.env or /app/healthcheck.sh do not exist.
  disable_healthcheck: false

  ## Authelia by default doesn't accept TLS communication on the server port. This section overrides this behaviour.
  tls:
    ## The path to the DER base64/PEM format private key.
    key: ""

    ## The path to the DER base64/PEM format public certificate.
    certificate: ""

##
## Log Configuration
##
log:
  ## Level of verbosity for logs: info, debug, trace.
  level: debug

  ## Format the logs are written as: json, text.
  # format: json

  ## File path where the logs will be written. If not set logs are written to stdout.
  # file_path: /config/authelia.log

  ## Whether to also log to stdout when a log_file_path is defined.
  # keep_stdout: false

##
## TOTP Configuration
##
## Parameters used for TOTP generation.
totp:
  ## The issuer name displayed in the Authenticator application of your choice
  ## See: https://github.com/google/google-authenticator/wiki/Key-Uri-Format for more info on issuer names
  issuer: authelia.com
  ## The period in seconds a one-time password is current for. Changing this will require all users to register
  ## their TOTP applications again. Warning: before changing period read the docs link below.
  period: 30
  ## The skew controls number of one-time passwords either side of the current one that are valid.
  ## Warning: before changing skew read the docs link below.
  skew: 1
  ## See: https://www.authelia.com/docs/configuration/one-time-password.html#period-and-skew to read the documentation.

##
## Duo Push API Configuration
##
## Parameters used to contact the Duo API. Those are generated when you protect an application of type
## "Partner Auth API" in the management panel.
duo_api:
  hostname: api-123456789.example.com
  integration_key: ABCDEF
  ## Secret can also be set using a secret: https://www.authelia.com/docs/configuration/secrets.html
  secret_key: 1234567890abcdefghifjkl

##
## Authentication Backend Provider Configuration
##
## Used for verifying user passwords and retrieve information such as email address and groups users belong to.
##
## The available providers are: `file`, `ldap`. You must use only one of these providers.
authentication_backend:
  ## Disable both the HTML element and the API for reset password functionality.
  disable_reset_password: false

  ## The amount of time to wait before we refresh data from the authentication backend. Uses duration notation.
  ## To disable this feature set it to 'disable', this will slightly reduce security because for Authelia, users will
  ## always belong to groups they belonged to at the time of login even if they have been removed from them in LDAP.
  ## To force update on every request you can set this to '0' or 'always', this will increase processor demand.
  ## See the below documentation for more information.
  ## Duration Notation docs:  https://www.authelia.com/docs/configuration/index.html#duration-notation-format
  ## Refresh Interval docs: https://www.authelia.com/docs/configuration/authentication/ldap.html#refresh-interval
  refresh_interval: 5m

  ##
  ## LDAP (Authentication Provider)
  ##
  ## This is the recommended Authentication Provider in production
  ## because it allows Authelia to offload the stateful operations
  ## onto the LDAP service.
  ldap:
    ## The LDAP implementation, this affects elements like the attribute utilised for resetting a password.
    ## Acceptable options are as follows:
    ## - 'activedirectory' - For Microsoft Active Directory.
    ## - 'custom' - For custom specifications of attributes and filters.
    ## This currently defaults to 'custom' to maintain existing behaviour.
    ##
    ## Depending on the option here certain other values in this section have a default value, notably all of the
    ## attribute mappings have a default value that this config overrides, you can read more about these default values
    ## at https://www.authelia.com/docs/configuration/authentication/ldap.html#defaults
    implementation: custom

    ## The url to the ldap server. Format: <scheme>://<address>[:<port>].
    ## Scheme can be ldap or ldaps in the format (port optional).
    url: ldap://127.0.0.1

    ## The dial timeout for LDAP.
    timeout: 5s

    ## Use StartTLS with the LDAP connection.
    start_tls: false

    tls:
      ## Server Name for certificate validation (in case it's not set correctly in the URL).
      # server_name: ldap.example.com

      ## Skip verifying the server certificate (to allow a self-signed certificate).
      ## In preference to setting this we strongly recommend you add the public portion of the certificate to the
      ## certificates directory which is defined by the `certificates_directory` option at the top of the config.
      skip_verify: false

      ## Minimum TLS version for either Secure LDAP or LDAP StartTLS.
      minimum_version: TLS1.2

    ## The distinguished name of the container searched for objects in the directory information tree.
    ## See also: additional_users_dn, additional_groups_dn.
    base_dn: dc=example,dc=com

    ## The attribute holding the username of the user. This attribute is used to populate the username in the session
    ## information. It was introduced due to #561 to handle case insensitive search queries. For you information,
    ## Microsoft Active Directory usually uses 'sAMAccountName' and OpenLDAP usually uses 'uid'. Beware that this
    ## attribute holds the unique identifiers for the users binding the user and the configuration stored in database.
    ## Therefore only single value attributes are allowed and the value must never be changed once attributed to a user
    ## otherwise it would break the configuration for that user. Technically, non-unique attributes like 'mail' can also
    ## be used but we don't recommend using them, we instead advise to use the attributes mentioned above
    ## (sAMAccountName and uid) to follow https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2307.txt.
    # username_attribute: uid

    ## The additional_users_dn is prefixed to base_dn and delimited by a comma when searching for users.
    ## i.e. with this set to OU=Users and base_dn set to DC=a,DC=com; OU=Users,DC=a,DC=com is searched for users.
    additional_users_dn: ou=users

    ## The users filter used in search queries to find the user profile based on input filled in login form.
    ## Various placeholders are available in the user filter which you can read about in the documentation which can
    ## be found at: https://www.authelia.com/docs/configuration/authentication/ldap.html#users-filter-replacements
    ##
    ## Recommended settings are as follows:
    ## - Microsoft Active Directory: (&({username_attribute}={input})(objectCategory=person)(objectClass=user))
    ## - OpenLDAP:
    ##   - (&({username_attribute}={input})(objectClass=person))
    ##   - (&({username_attribute}={input})(objectClass=inetOrgPerson))
    ##
    ## To allow sign in both with username and email, one can use a filter like
    ## (&(|({username_attribute}={input})({mail_attribute}={input}))(objectClass=person))
    users_filter: (&({username_attribute}={input})(objectClass=person))

    ## The additional_groups_dn is prefixed to base_dn and delimited by a comma when searching for groups.
    ## i.e. with this set to OU=Groups and base_dn set to DC=a,DC=com; OU=Groups,DC=a,DC=com is searched for groups.
    additional_groups_dn: ou=groups

    ## The groups filter used in search queries to find the groups based on relevant authenticated user.
    ## Various placeholders are available in the groups filter which you can read about in the documentation which can
    ## be found at: https://www.authelia.com/docs/configuration/authentication/ldap.html#groups-filter-replacements
    ##
    ## If your groups use the `groupOfUniqueNames` structure use this instead:
    ##    (&(uniqueMember={dn})(objectClass=groupOfUniqueNames))
    groups_filter: (&(member={dn})(objectClass=groupOfNames))

    ## The attribute holding the name of the group.
    # group_name_attribute: cn

    ## The attribute holding the mail address of the user. If multiple email addresses are defined for a user, only the
    ## first one returned by the LDAP server is used.
    # mail_attribute: mail

    ## The attribute holding the display name of the user. This will be used to greet an authenticated user.
    # display_name_attribute: displayName

    ## The username and password of the admin user.
    user: cn=admin,dc=example,dc=com
    ## Password can also be set using a secret: https://www.authelia.com/docs/configuration/secrets.html
    password: password

  ##
  ## File (Authentication Provider)
  ##
  ## With this backend, the users database is stored in a file which is updated when users reset their passwords.
  ## Therefore, this backend is meant to be used in a dev environment and not in production since it prevents Authelia
  ## to be scaled to more than one instance. The options under 'password' have sane defaults, and as it has security
  ## implications it is highly recommended you leave the default values. Before considering changing these settings
  ## please read the docs page below:
  ## https://www.authelia.com/docs/configuration/authentication/file.html#password-hash-algorithm-tuning
  ##
  ## Important: Kubernetes (or HA) users must read https://www.authelia.com/docs/features/statelessness.html
  ##
  # file:
  #   path: /config/users_database.yml
  #   password:
  #     algorithm: argon2id
  #     iterations: 1
  #     key_length: 32
  #     salt_length: 16
  #     memory: 1024
  #     parallelism: 8

##
## Access Control Configuration
##
## Access control is a list of rules defining the authorizations applied for one resource to users or group of users.
##
## If 'access_control' is not defined, ACL rules are disabled and the 'bypass' rule is applied, i.e., access is allowed
## to anyone. Otherwise restrictions follow the rules defined.
##
## Note: One can use the wildcard * to match any subdomain.
## It must stand at the beginning of the pattern. (example: *.mydomain.com)
##
## Note: You must put patterns containing wildcards between simple quotes for the YAML to be syntactically correct.
##
## Definition: A 'rule' is an object with the following keys: 'domain', 'subject', 'policy' and 'resources'.
##
## - 'domain' defines which domain or set of domains the rule applies to.
##
## - 'subject' defines the subject to apply authorizations to. This parameter is optional and matching any user if not
##    provided. If provided, the parameter represents either a user or a group. It should be of the form
##    'user:<username>' or 'group:<groupname>'.
##
## - 'policy' is the policy to apply to resources. It must be either 'bypass', 'one_factor', 'two_factor' or 'deny'.
##
## - 'resources' is a list of regular expressions that matches a set of resources to apply the policy to. This parameter
##   is optional and matches any resource if not provided.
##
## Note: the order of the rules is important. The first policy matching (domain, resource, subject) applies.
access_control:
  ## Default policy can either be 'bypass', 'one_factor', 'two_factor' or 'deny'. It is the policy applied to any
  ## resource if there is no policy to be applied to the user.
  default_policy: deny

  networks:
    - name: internal
      networks:

        - "^/users/bob/.*$"
      subject: "user:bob"
      policy: two_factor

##
## Session Provider Configuration
##
## The session cookies identify the user once logged in.
## The available providers are: `memory`, `redis`. Memory is the provider unless redis is defined.
session:
  ## The name of the session cookie.
  name: authelia_session

  ## The domain to protect.
  ## Note: the authenticator must also be in that domain.
  ## If empty, the cookie is restricted to the subdomain of the issuer.
  domain: example.com

  ## Sets the Cookie SameSite value. Possible options are none, lax, or strict.
  ## Please read https://www.authelia.com/docs/configuration/session.html#same_site
  same_site: lax

  ## The secret to encrypt the session data. This is only used with Redis / Redis Sentinel.
  ## Secret can also be set using a secret: https://www.authelia.com/docs/configuration/secrets.html
  secret: insecure_session_secret

  ## The value for expiration, inactivity, and remember_me_duration are in seconds or the duration notation format.
  ## See: https://www.authelia.com/docs/configuration/index.html#duration-notation-format
  ## All three of these values affect the cookie/session validity period. Longer periods are considered less secure
  ## because a stolen cookie will last longer giving attackers more time to spy or attack.

  ## The time before the cookie expires and the session is destroyed if remember me IS NOT selected.
  expiration: 1h

  ## The inactivity time before the session is reset. If expiration is set to 1h, and this is set to 5m, if the user
  ## does not select the remember me option their session will get destroyed after 1h, or after 5m since the last time
  ## Authelia detected user activity.
  inactivity: 5m

  ## The time before the cookie expires and the session is destroyed if remember me IS selected.
  ## Value of 0 disables remember me.
  remember_me_duration: 1M

  ##
  ## Redis Provider
  ##
  ## Important: Kubernetes (or HA) users must read https://www.authelia.com/docs/features/statelessness.html
  ##
  redis:
    host: 127.0.0.1
    port: 6379
    ## Use a unix socket instead
    # host: /var/run/redis/redis.sock

    ## Username used for redis authentication. This is optional and a new feature in redis 6.0.
    # username: authelia

    ## Password can also be set using a secret: https://www.authelia.com/docs/configuration/secrets.html
    password: authelia

    ## This is the Redis DB Index https://redis.io/commands/select (sometimes referred to as database number, DB, etc).
    database_index: 0

    ## The maximum number of concurrent active connections to Redis.
    maximum_active_connections: 8

    ## The target number of idle connections to have open ready for work. Useful when opening connections is slow.
    minimum_idle_connections: 0

    ## The Redis TLS configuration. If defined will require a TLS connection to the Redis instance(s).
    # tls:
      ## Server Name for certificate validation (in case you are using the IP or non-FQDN in the host option).
      # server_name: myredis.example.com

      ## Skip verifying the server certificate (to allow a self-signed certificate).
      ## In preference to setting this we strongly recommend you add the public portion of the certificate to the
      ## certificates directory which is defined by the `certificates_directory` option at the top of the config.
      # skip_verify: false

      ## Minimum TLS version for the connection.
      # minimum_version: TLS1.2

    ## The Redis HA configuration options.
    ## This provides specific options to Redis Sentinel, sentinel_name must be defined (Master Name).
    # high_availability:
      ## Sentinel Name / Master Name.
      # sentinel_name: mysentinel

      ## Specific password for Redis Sentinel. The node username and password is configured above.
      # sentinel_password: sentinel_specific_pass

      ## The additional nodes to pre-seed the redis provider with (for sentinel).
      ## If the host in the above section is defined, it will be combined with this list to connect to sentinel.
      ## For high availability to be used you must have either defined; the host above or at least one node below.
      # nodes:
      #   - host: sentinel-node1
      #     port: 6379
      #   - host: sentinel-node2
      #     port: 6379

      ## Choose the host with the lowest latency.
      # route_by_latency: false

      ## Choose the host randomly.
      # route_randomly: false

##
## Regulation Configuration
##
## This mechanism prevents attackers from brute forcing the first factor. It bans the user if too many attempts are made
## in a short period of time.
regulation:
  ## The number of failed login attempts before user is banned. Set it to 0 to disable regulation.
  max_retries: 3

  ## The time range during which the user can attempt login before being banned. The user is banned if the
  ## authentication failed 'max_retries' times in a 'find_time' seconds window. Find Time accepts duration notation.
  ## See: https://www.authelia.com/docs/configuration/index.html#duration-notation-format
  find_time: 2m

  ## The length of time before a banned user can login again. Ban Time accepts duration notation.
  ## See: https://www.authelia.com/docs/configuration/index.html#duration-notation-format
  ban_time: 5m

##
## Storage Provider Configuration
##
## The available providers are: `local`, `mysql`, `postgres`. You must use one and only one of these providers.
storage:
  ##
  ## Local (Storage Provider)
  ##
  ## This stores the data in a SQLite3 Database.
  ## This is only recommended for lightweight non-stateful installations.
  ##
  ## Important: Kubernetes (or HA) users must read https://www.authelia.com/docs/features/statelessness.html
  ##
  # local:
  #   path: /config/db.sqlite3

  ##
  ## MySQL / MariaDB (Storage Provider)
  ##
  mysql:
    host: 127.0.0.1
    port: 3306
    database: authelia
    username: authelia
    ## Password can also be set using a secret: https://www.authelia.com/docs/configuration/secrets.html
    password: mypassword
    timeout: 5s

  ##
  ## PostgreSQL (Storage Provider)
  ##
  # postgres:
  #   host: 127.0.0.1
  #   port: 5432
  #   database: authelia
  #   username: authelia
  #   ## Password can also be set using a secret: https://www.authelia.com/docs/configuration/secrets.html
  #   password: mypassword
  #   timeout: 5s
  #   sslmode: disable

##
## Notification Provider
##
## Notifications are sent to users when they require a password reset, a U2F registration or a TOTP registration.
## The available providers are: filesystem, smtp. You must use only one of these providers.
notifier:
  ## You can disable the notifier startup check by setting this to true.
  disable_startup_check: false

  ##
  ## File System (Notification Provider)
  ##
  ## Important: Kubernetes (or HA) users must read https://www.authelia.com/docs/features/statelessness.html
  ##
  # filesystem:
  #   filename: /config/notification.txt

  ##
  ## SMTP (Notification Provider)
  ##
  ## Use a SMTP server for sending notifications. Authelia uses the PLAIN or LOGIN methods to authenticate.
  ## [Security] By default Authelia will:
  ##   - force all SMTP connections over TLS including unauthenticated connections
  ##      - use the disable_require_tls boolean value to disable this requirement
  ##        (only works for unauthenticated connections)
  ##   - validate the SMTP server x509 certificate during the TLS handshake against the hosts trusted certificates
  ##     (configure in tls section)
  smtp:
    ## The SMTP host to connect to.
    host: 127.0.0.1

    ## The port to connect to the SMTP host on.
    port: 1025

    ## The connection timeout.
    timeout: 5s

    ## The username used for SMTP authentication.
    username: test

    ## The password used for SMTP authentication.
    ## Can also be set using a secret: https://www.authelia.com/docs/configuration/secrets.html
    password: password

    ## The address to send the email FROM.
    sender: admin@example.com

    ## HELO/EHLO Identifier. Some SMTP Servers may reject the default of localhost.
    identifier: localhost

    ## Subject configuration of the emails sent. {title} is replaced by the text from the notifier.
    subject: "[Authelia] {title}"

    ## This address is used during the startup check to verify the email configuration is correct.
    ## It's not important what it is except if your email server only allows local delivery.
    startup_check_address: test@authelia.com

    ## By default we require some form of TLS. This disables this check though is not advised.
    disable_require_tls: false

    ## Disables sending HTML formatted emails.
    disable_html_emails: false

    tls:
      ## Server Name for certificate validation (in case you are using the IP or non-FQDN in the host option).
      # server_name: smtp.example.com

      ## Skip verifying the server certificate (to allow a self-signed certificate).
      ## In preference to setting this we strongly recommend you add the public portion of the certificate to the
      ## certificates directory which is defined by the `certificates_directory` option at the top of the config.
      skip_verify: false

      ## Minimum TLS version for either StartTLS or SMTPS.
      minimum_version: TLS1.2

##
## Identity Providers
##
# identity_providers:

  ##
  ## OpenID Connect (Identity Provider)
  ##
  ## It's recommended you read the documentation before configuration of this section:
  ## https://www.authelia.com/docs/configuration/identity-providers/oidc.html
  # oidc:
    ## The hmac_secret is used to sign OAuth2 tokens (authorization code, access tokens and refresh tokens).
    ## HMAC Secret can also be set using a secret: https://www.authelia.com/docs/configuration/secrets.html
    # hmac_secret: this_is_a_secret_abc123abc123abc

    ## The issuer_private_key is used to sign the JWT forged by OpenID Connect.
    ## Issuer Private Key can also be set using a secret: https://docs.authelia.com/configuration/secrets.html
    # issuer_private_key: |
    #   --- KEY START
    #   --- KEY END

    ## The lifespans configure the expiration for these token types.
    # access_token_lifespan: 1h
    # authorize_code_lifespan: 1m
    # id_token_lifespan: 1h
    # refresh_token_lifespan: 90m

    ## Enables additional debug messages.
    # enable_client_debug_messages: false

    ## SECURITY NOTICE: It's not recommended changing this option, and highly discouraged to have it below 8 for
    ## security reasons.
    # minimum_parameter_entropy: 8

    ## Clients is a list of known clients and their configuration.
    # clients:
      # -
        ## The ID is the OpenID Connect ClientID which is used to link an application to a configuration.
        # id: myapp

        ## The description to show to users when they end up on the consent screen. Defaults to the ID above.
        # description: My Application

        ## The client secret is a shared secret between Authelia and the consumer of this client.
        # secret: this_is_a_secret
