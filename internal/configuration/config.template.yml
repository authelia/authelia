## Notes:
##
##    - the default location of this file is assumed to be configuration.yml unless otherwise noted
##    - when using docker the container expects this by default to be at /config/configuration.yml
##    - the default location where this file is loaded from can be overridden with the X_AUTHELIA_CONFIG environment var
##    - the comments in this configuration file are helpful but users should consult the official documentation on the
##      website at https://www.authelia.com/ or https://www.authelia.com/configuration/prologue/introduction/
##    - this configuration file template is not automatically updated
##

## Certificates directory specifies where Authelia will load trusted certificates (public portion) from in addition to
## the system certificates store.
## They should be in base64 format, and have one of the following extensions: *.cer, *.crt, *.pem.
# certificates_directory: '/config/certificates/'

## The theme to display: light, dark, grey, auto.
# theme: 'light'

## The login portal template to apply. Set to 'none' to use the built-in default or provide the name of a template
## present under the branding templates directory.
# portal_template: 'none'

## When true, displays a palette button on the login page to allow switching between available templates.
# portal_template_switcher: false

## Set the default 2FA method for new users and for when a user has a preferred method configured that has been
## disabled. This setting must be a method that is enabled.
## Options are totp, webauthn, mobile_push.
# default_2fa_method: ''

##
## Server Configuration
##
# server:
  ## The address for the Main server to listen on in the address common syntax.
  ## Formats:
  ##  - [<scheme>://]<hostname>[:<port>][/<path>]
  ##  - [<scheme>://][hostname]:<port>[/<path>]
  ## Square brackets indicate optional portions of the format. Scheme must be 'tcp', 'tcp4', 'tcp6', 'unix', or 'fd'.
  ## The default scheme is 'unix' if the address is an absolute path otherwise it's 'tcp'. The default port is '9091'.
  ## If the path is specified this configures the router to handle both the `/` path and the configured path.
  # address: 'tcp://:9091/'

  ## Set the path on disk to Authelia assets.
  ## Useful to allow overriding of specific static assets.
  # asset_path: '/config/assets/'

  ## Disables writing the health check vars to /app/.healthcheck.env which makes healthcheck.sh return exit code 0.
  ## This is disabled by default if either /app/.healthcheck.env or /app/healthcheck.sh do not exist.
  # disable_healthcheck: false

  ## Authelia by default doesn't accept TLS communication on the server port. This section overrides this behaviour.
  # tls:
    ## The path to the DER base64/PEM format private key.
    # key: ''

  ## The number of digits a user has to input. Must either be 6 or 8.
  ## Changing this option only affects newly generated TOTP configurations.
  ## It is CRITICAL you read the documentation before changing this option:
  ## https://www.authelia.com/c/totp#digits
  # digits: 6

  ## The period in seconds a Time-based One-Time Password is valid for.
  ## Changing this option only affects newly generated TOTP configurations.
  # period: 30

  ## The skew controls number of Time-based One-Time Passwords either side of the current one that are valid.
  ## Warning: before changing skew read the docs link below.
  # skew: 1
  ## See: https://www.authelia.com/c/totp#input-validation to read
  ## the documentation.

  ## The size of the generated shared secrets. Default is 32 and is sufficient in most use cases, minimum is 20.
  # secret_size: 32

  ## The allowed algorithms for a user to pick from.
  # allowed_algorithms:
  # - 'SHA1'

  ## The allowed digits for a user to pick from.
  # allowed_digits:
  # - 6

  ## The allowed periods for a user to pick from.
  # allowed_periods:
  # - 30

  ## Disable the reuse security policy which prevents replays of one-time password code values.

  # enable_passkey_login: false

  ## The display name the browser should show the user for when using WebAuthn to login/register.
  # display_name: 'Authelia'

  ## Conveyance preference controls if we collect the attestation statement including the AAGUID from the device.
  ## Options are none, indirect, direct.
  # attestation_conveyance_preference: 'indirect'

  ## The interaction timeout for WebAuthn dialogues in the duration common syntax.
  # timeout: '60 seconds'

  ## Authenticator Filtering.
  # filtering:
    ## Prohibits registering Authenticators that claim they can export their credentials in some way.
    # prohibit_backup_eligibility: false

    ## Permitted AAGUID's. If configured specifically only allows the listed AAGUID's.
    # permitted_aaguids: []

    ## Prohibited AAGUID's. If configured prohibits the use of specific AAGUID's.
    # prohibited_aaguids: []

  ## Selection Criteria controls the preferences for registration.
  # selection_criteria:
    ## The attachment preference. Either 'cross-platform' for dedicated authenticators, or 'platform' for embedded
    ## authenticators.
    # attachment: 'cross-platform'

    # discoverability: 'discouraged'

    ## User verification controls if the user must make a gesture or action to confirm they are present.
    ## Options are required, preferred, discouraged.
    # user_verification: 'preferred'

  ## Metadata Service validation via MDS3.
  # metadata:

    ## Enable the metadata fetch behaviour.
    # enabled: false

    ## Configure the Cache Policy for the Metadata Service.
    # cache_policy: 'strict'

    ## Enable Validation of the Trust Anchor. This generally should be enabled if you're using the metadata. It
    ## ensures the attestation certificate presented by the authenticator is valid against the MDS3 certificate that
    ## issued the attestation certificate.
    # validate_trust_anchor: true

    ## Enable Validation of the Entry. This ensures that the MDS3 actually contains the metadata entry. If not enabled
    ## attestation certificates which are not formally registered will be skipped. This may potentially exclude some
    ## virtual authenticators.
    # validate_entry: true

    ## Enabling this allows attestation certificates with a zero AAGUID to pass validation. This is important if you do
    ## use non-conformant authenticators like Apple ID.
    # validate_entry_permit_zero_aaguid: false

    ## Enable Validation of the Authenticator Status.
    # validate_status: true

    ## List of statuses which are considered permitted when validating an authenticator's metadata. Generally it is
    ## recommended that this is not configured as any other status the authenticator's metadata has will result in an
    ## error. This option is ineffectual if validate_status is false.
    # validate_status_permitted: ~

    ## List of statuses that should be prohibited when validating an authenticator's metadata. Generally it is
    ## recommended that this is not configured as there are safe defaults. This option is ineffectual if validate_status
    ## is false, or validate_status_permitted has values.
    # validate_status_prohibited: ~

##
## Duo Push API Configuration
##
## Parameters used to contact the Duo API. Those are generated when you protect an application of type
## "Partner Auth API" in the management panel.
# duo_api:
  # disable: false
  # hostname: 'api-123456789.example.com'
  # integration_key: 'ABCDEF'
  ## Secret can also be set using a secret: https://www.authelia.com/c/secrets
  # secret_key: '1234567890abcdefghifjkl'
  # enable_self_enrollment: false

##
## Identity Validation Configuration
##
## This configuration tunes the identity validation flows.
identity_validation:

  ## Reset Password flow. Adjusts how the reset password flow operates.
  reset_password:
    ## Maximum allowed time before the JWT is generated and when the user uses it in the duration common syntax.
    # jwt_lifespan: '5 minutes'

    ## The algorithm used for the Reset Password JWT.
    # jwt_algorithm: 'HS256'

    ## The secret key used to sign and verify the JWT.
    jwt_secret: 'a_very_important_secret'

  ## Elevated Session flows. Adjusts the flow which require elevated sessions for example managing credentials, adding,
  ## removing, etc.
  # elevated_session:
    ## Maximum allowed lifetime after the One-Time Code is generated that it is considered valid.
    # code_lifespan: '5 minutes'

    ## Maximum allowed lifetime after the user uses the One-Time Code and the user must perform the validation again in
    ## the duration common syntax.
    # elevation_lifespan: '10 minutes'

    ## Number of characters the one-time password contains.
    # characters: 8

    ## In addition to the One-Time Code requires the user performs a second factor authentication.
    # require_second_factor: false

    ## Skips the elevation requirement and entry of the One-Time Code if the user has performed second factor
    ## authentication.
    # skip_second_factor: false

##
## NTP Configuration
##
## This is used to validate the servers time is accurate enough to validate TOTP.
# ntp:
  ## The address of the NTP server to connect to in the address common syntax.
  ## Format: [<scheme>://]<hostname>[:<port>].
  ## Square brackets indicate optional portions of the format. Scheme must be 'udp', 'udp4', or 'udp6'.
  ## The default scheme is 'udp'. The default port is '123'.
  # address: 'udp://time.cloudflare.com:123'

  ## NTP version.
  # version: 4

  ## Maximum allowed time offset between the host and the NTP server in the duration common syntax.
  # max_desync: '3 seconds'

  ## Disables the NTP check on startup entirely. This means Authelia will not contact a remote service at all if you
  ## set this to true, and can operate in a truly offline mode.
  # disable_startup_check: false

  ## The default of false will prevent startup only if we can contact the NTP server and the time is out of sync with
  ## the NTP server more than the configured max_desync. If you set this to true, an error will be logged but startup
  ## will continue regardless of results.
  # disable_failure: false

##
## Definitions
##
## The definitions are used in other areas as reference points to reduce duplication.
##
# definitions:
  ## The user attribute definitions.
  # user_attributes:
    ## The name of the definition.
    # definition_name:
      ## The common expression language expression for this definition.
      # expression: ''

  ## The network definitions.
  # network:
    ## The name of the definition followed by the list of CIDR network addresses in this definition.
    # internal:
      # - '10.10.0.0/16'
      # - '172.16.0.0/12'
      # - '192.168.2.0/24'
    # VPN:
      # - '10.9.0.0/16'

##
## Authentication Backend Provider Configuration
##
## Used for verifying user passwords and retrieve information such as email address and groups users belong to.
##
## The available providers are: `file`, `ldap`. You must use only one of these providers.
# authentication_backend:
  ## Password Change Options.
  # password_change:
    ## Disable both the HTML element and the API for password change functionality.
    # disable: false
  ## Password Reset Options.
  # password_reset:
    ## Disable both the HTML element and the API for reset password functionality.
    # disable: false

    ## External reset password url that redirects the user to an external reset portal. This disables the internal reset
    ## functionality.
    # custom_url: ''

  ## The amount of time to wait before we refresh data from the authentication backend in the duration common syntax.
  ## To disable this feature set it to 'disable', this will slightly reduce security because for Authelia, users will
  ## always belong to groups they belonged to at the time of login even if they have been removed from them in LDAP.
  ## To force update on every request you can set this to '0' or 'always', this will increase processor demand.
  ## See the below documentation for more information.
  ## Refresh Interval docs: https://www.authelia.com/c/1fa#refresh-interval
  # refresh_interval: '5 minutes'

  ##
  ## LDAP (Authentication Provider)
  ##
  ## This is the recommended Authentication Provider in production
  ## because it allows Authelia to offload the stateful operations
  ## onto the LDAP service.
  # ldap:
    ## The address of the directory server to connect to in the address common syntax.
    ## Format: [<scheme>://]<hostname>[:<port>].
    ## Square brackets indicate optional portions of the format. Scheme must be 'ldap', 'ldaps', or 'ldapi`.
    ## The default scheme is 'ldapi' if the address is an absolute path otherwise it's 'ldaps'.
    ## The default port is '636', unless the scheme is 'ldap' in which case it's '389'.
    # address: 'ldaps://127.0.0.1:636'

    ## The LDAP implementation, this affects elements like the attribute utilised for resetting a password.
    ## Acceptable options are as follows:
    ## - 'activedirectory' - for Microsoft Active Directory.
    ## - 'freeipa' - for FreeIPA.
    ## - 'lldap' - for lldap.
    ## - 'custom' - for custom specifications of attributes and filters.
    ## This currently defaults to 'custom' to maintain existing behaviour.
    ##
    ## Depending on the option here certain other values in this section have a default value, notably all of the
    ## attribute mappings have a default value that this config overrides, you can read more about these default values
    ## at https://www.authelia.com/c/ldap#defaults
    # implementation: 'custom'

    ## The dial timeout for LDAP in the duration common syntax.
    # timeout: '20 seconds'

    ## Use StartTLS with the LDAP connection.
    # start_tls: false

    ## TLS configuration.
    # tls:
      ## The server subject name to check the servers certificate against during the validation process.
      ## This option is not required if the certificate has a SAN which matches the address options hostname.
      # server_name: 'ldap.example.com'

      ## Skip verifying the server certificate entirely. In preference to setting this we strongly recommend you add the
      ## certificate or the certificate of the authority signing the certificate to the certificates directory which is
      ## defined by the `certificates_directory` option at the top of the configuration.
      ## It's important to note the public key should be added to the directory, not the private key.
      ## This option is strongly discouraged but may be useful in some self-signed situations where validation is not
      ## important to the administrator.
      # skip_verify: false

      ## Minimum TLS version for the connection.
      # minimum_version: 'TLS1.2'

      ## Maximum TLS version for the connection.
      # maximum_version: 'TLS1.3'

      ## The certificate chain used with the private_key if the server requests TLS Client Authentication
      ## i.e. Mutual TLS.
      # certificate_chain: |
        # -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
        # ...
        # -----END CERTIFICATE-----
        # -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
        # ...
        # -----END CERTIFICATE-----

      ## The private key used with the certificate_chain if the server requests TLS Client Authentication
      ## i.e. Mutual TLS.
      # private_key: |
        # -----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----
        # ...
        # -----END PRIVATE KEY-----

    ## Connection Pooling configuration.
    # pooling:
      ## Enable Pooling.
      # enable: false

      ## Pool count.
      # count: 5

      ## Retries to obtain a connection during the timeout.
      # retries: 2

      ## Timeout before the attempt to obtain a connection fails.
      # timeout: '10 seconds'

    ## The distinguished name of the container searched for objects in the directory information tree.
    ## See also: additional_users_dn, additional_groups_dn.
    # base_dn: 'dc=example,dc=com'

    ## The additional_users_dn is prefixed to base_dn and delimited by a comma when searching for users.
    ## i.e. with this set to OU=Users and base_dn set to DC=a,DC=com; OU=Users,DC=a,DC=com is searched for users.
    # additional_users_dn: 'ou=users'

    ## The users filter used in search queries to find the user profile based on input filled in login form.
    ## Various placeholders are available in the user filter which you can read about in the documentation which can
    ## be found at: https://www.authelia.com/c/ldap#users-filter-replacements
    ##
    ## Recommended settings are as follows:
    ## - Microsoft Active Directory: (&({username_attribute}={input})(objectCategory=person)(objectClass=user))
    ## - OpenLDAP:
    ##   - (&({username_attribute}={input})(objectClass=person))
    ##   - (&({username_attribute}={input})(objectClass=inetOrgPerson))
    ##
    ## To allow sign in both with username and email, one can use a filter like
    ## (&(|({username_attribute}={input})({mail_attribute}={input}))(objectClass=person))
    # users_filter: '(&({username_attribute}={input})(objectClass=person))'

    ## The additional_groups_dn is prefixed to base_dn and delimited by a comma when searching for groups.
    ## i.e. with this set to OU=Groups and base_dn set to DC=a,DC=com; OU=Groups,DC=a,DC=com is searched for groups.
    # additional_groups_dn: 'ou=groups'

    ## The groups filter used in search queries to find the groups based on relevant authenticated user.
    ## Various placeholders are available in the groups filter which you can read about in the documentation which can
    ## be found at: https://www.authelia.com/c/ldap#groups-filter-replacements
    ##
    ## If your groups use the `groupOfUniqueNames` structure use this instead:
    ##    (&(uniqueMember={dn})(objectClass=groupOfUniqueNames))
    # groups_filter: '(&(member={dn})(objectClass=groupOfNames))'

    ## The group search mode to use. Options are 'filter' or 'memberof'. It's essential to read the docs if you wish to
    ## use 'memberof'. Also 'filter' is the best choice for most use cases.
    # group_search_mode: 'filter'

    ## Follow referrals returned by the server.
    ## This is especially useful for environments where read-only servers exist. Only implemented for write operations.
    # permit_referrals: false

    ## The username and password of the admin user.
    # user: 'cn=admin,dc=example,dc=com'
    ## Password can also be set using a secret: https://www.authelia.com/c/secrets
    # password: 'password'

    ## The attributes for users and objects from the directory server.
    # attributes:

      ## The distinguished name attribute if your directory server supports it. Users should read the docs before
      ## configuring. Only used for the 'memberof' group search mode.
      # distinguished_name: ''

      ## The attribute holding the username of the user. This attribute is used to populate the username in the session
      ## information. For your information, Microsoft Active Directory usually uses 'sAMAccountName' and OpenLDAP
      ## usually uses 'uid'. Beware that this attribute holds the unique identifiers for the users binding the user and
      ## the configuration stored in database; therefore only single value attributes are allowed and the value must
      ## never be changed once attributed to a user otherwise it would break the configuration for that user.
      ## Technically non-unique attributes like 'mail' can also be used but we don't recommend using them, we instead
      ## advise to use a filter to perform alternative lookups and the attributes mentioned above
      ## (sAMAccountName and uid) to follow https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2307.
      # username: 'uid'

      ## The attribute holding the display name of the user. This will be used to greet an authenticated user.
      # display_name: 'displayName'

      ## The attribute holding the mail address of the user. If multiple email addresses are defined for a user, only
      ## the first one returned by the directory server is used.
      # mail: 'mail'

      ## The attribute which provides distinguished names of groups an object is a member of.
      ## Only used for the 'memberof' group search mode.
      # member_of: 'memberOf'

      ## The attribute holding the name of the group.
      # group_name: 'cn'

  ##
  ## File (Authentication Provider)
  ##
  ## With this backend, the users database is stored in a file which is updated when users reset their passwords.
  ## Therefore, this backend is meant to be used in a dev environment and not in production since it prevents Authelia
  ## to be scaled to more than one instance. The options under 'password' have sane defaults, and as it has security
  ## implications it is highly recommended you leave the default values. Before considering changing these settings
  ## please read the docs page below:
  ## https://www.authelia.com/r/passwords#tuning

  # require_user_acceptance: false

  ## The URL of the privacy policy document. Must be an absolute URL and must have the 'https://' scheme.
  ## If the privacy policy enabled option is true, this MUST be provided.
  # policy_url: ''

##
## Access Control Configuration
##
## Access control is a list of rules defining the authorizations applied for one resource to users or group of users.
##
## If 'access_control' is not defined, ACL rules are disabled and the 'deny' rule is applied, i.e., access is denied
## to everyone. Otherwise restrictions follow the rules defined.
##
## Note: One can use the wildcard * to match any subdomain.
## It must stand at the beginning of the pattern. (example: *.example.com)
##
## Note: You must put patterns containing wildcards between simple quotes for the YAML to be syntactically correct.
##
## Definition: A 'rule' is an object with the following keys: 'domain', 'subject', 'policy' and 'resources'.
##
## - 'domain' defines which domain or set of domains the rule applies to.
##
## - 'subject' defines the subject to apply authorizations to. This parameter is optional and matching any user if not
##    provided. If provided, the parameter represents either a user or a group. It should be of the form
##    'user:<username>' or 'group:<groupname>'.
##
## - 'policy' is the policy to apply to resources. It must be either 'bypass', 'one_factor', 'two_factor' or 'deny'.
##
## - 'resources' is a list of regular expressions that matches a set of resources to apply the policy to. This parameter
##   is optional and matches any resource if not provided.
##
## Note: the order of the rules is important. The first policy matching (domain, resource, subject) applies.
# access_control:
  ## Default policy can either be 'bypass', 'one_factor', 'two_factor' or 'deny'. It is the policy applied to any
  ## resource if there is no policy to be applied to the user.
  # default_policy: 'deny'

  # rules:
    ## Rules applied to everyone
    # - domain: 'public.example.com'
    #   policy: 'bypass'

    ## Domain Regex examples. Generally we recommend just using a standard domain.
    # - domain_regex: '^(?P<User>\w+)\.example\.com$'
    #   policy: 'one_factor'
    # - domain_regex: '^(?P<Group>\w+)\.example\.com$'
    #   policy: 'one_factor'
    # - domain_regex:
      #  - '^appgroup-.*\.example\.com$'
      #  - '^appgroup2-.*\.example\.com$'
    #   policy: 'one_factor'
    # - domain_regex: '^.*\.example\.com$'
    #   policy: 'two_factor'

    # - domain: 'secure.example.com'
    #   policy: 'one_factor'
    ## Network based rule, if not provided any network matches.
    #   networks:
        # - 'internal'
        # - 'VPN'
        # - '192.168.1.0/24'
        # - '10.0.0.1'

    # - domain:
        # - 'secure.example.com'
        # - 'private.example.com'
    #   policy: 'two_factor'

    # - domain: 'singlefactor.example.com'
    #   policy: 'one_factor'

    ## Rules applied to 'admins' group
    # - domain: 'mx2.mail.example.com'
    #   subject: 'group:admins'
    #   policy: 'deny'

    # - domain: '*.example.com'
    #   subject:
        # - 'group:admins'
        # - 'group:moderators'
    #   policy: 'two_factor'

    ## Rules applied to 'dev' group
    # - domain: 'dev.example.com'
    #   resources:
        # - '^/groups/dev/.*$'
    #   subject: 'group:dev'
    #   policy: 'two_factor'

    ## Rules applied to user 'john'
    # - domain: 'dev.example.com'
    #   resources:
        # - '^/users/john/.*$'
    #   subject: 'user:john'
    #   policy: 'two_factor'

    ## Rules applied to user 'harry'
    # - domain: 'dev.example.com'
    #   resources:
        # - '^/users/harry/.*$'
    #   subject: 'user:harry'
    #   policy: 'two_factor'

    ## Rules applied to user 'bob'
    # - domain: '*.mail.example.com'
    #   subject: 'user:bob'
    #   policy: 'two_factor'
    # - domain: 'dev.example.com'
    #   resources:
    #     - '^/users/bob/.*$'
    #   subject: 'user:bob'
    #   policy: 'two_factor'

##
## Session Provider Configuration
##
## The session cookies identify the user once logged in.
## The available providers are: `memory`, `redis`. Memory is the provider unless redis is defined.
session:
  ## The secret to encrypt the session data. This is only used with Redis / Redis Sentinel.
  ## Secret can also be set using a secret: https://www.authelia.com/c/secrets
  secret: 'insecure_session_secret'

  ## Cookies configures the list of allowed cookie domains for sessions to be created on.
  ## Undefined values will default to the values below.
  # cookies:
  #   -
      ## The name of the session cookie.
      # name: 'authelia_session'

      ## The domain to protect.
      ## Note: the Authelia portal must also be in that domain.
      # domain: 'example.com'

      ## Required. The fully qualified URI of the portal to redirect users to on proxies that support redirections.
      ## Rules:
      ##   - MUST use the secure scheme 'https://'
      ##   - The above 'domain' option MUST either:
      ##      - Match the host portion of this URI.
      ##      - Match the suffix of the host portion when prefixed with '.'.
      # authelia_url: 'https://auth.example.com'

      ## Optional. The fully qualified URI used as the redirection location if the portal is accessed directly. Not
      ## configuring this option disables the automatic redirection behaviour.
      ##
      ## Note: this parameter is optional. If not provided, user won't be redirected upon successful authentication
      ## unless they were redirected to Authelia by the proxy.
      ##
      ## Rules:
      ##   - MUST use the secure scheme 'https://'
      ##   - MUST not match the 'authelia_url' option.
      ##   - The above 'domain' option MUST either:
      ##      - Match the host portion of this URI.
      ##      - Match the suffix of the host portion when prefixed with '.'.
      # default_redirection_url: 'https://www.example.com'

      ## Sets the Cookie SameSite value. Possible options are none, lax, or strict.
      ## Please read https://www.authelia.com/c/session#same_site
      # same_site: 'lax'

      ## The value for inactivity, expiration, and remember_me are in seconds or the duration common syntax.
      ## All three of these values affect the cookie/session validity period. Longer periods are considered less secure
      ## because a stolen cookie will last longer giving attackers more time to spy or attack.

      ## The inactivity time before the session is reset. If expiration is set to 1h, and this is set to 5m, if the user
      ## does not select the remember me option their session will get destroyed after 1h, or after 5m since the last
      ## time Authelia detected user activity.
      # inactivity: '5 minutes'

      ## The time before the session cookie expires and the session is destroyed if remember me IS NOT selected by the
      ## user.
      # expiration: '1 hour'

      ## The time before the cookie expires and the session is destroyed if remember me IS selected by the user. Setting
      ## this value to -1 disables remember me for this session cookie domain. If allowed and the user uses the remember
      ## me checkbox this overrides the expiration option and disables the inactivity option.
      # remember_me: '1 month'

  ## Cookie Session Domain default 'name' value.
  # name: 'authelia_session'

  ## Cookie Session Domain default 'same_site' value.
  # same_site: 'lax'

  ## Cookie Session Domain default 'inactivity' value.
  # inactivity: '5m'

  ## Cookie Session Domain default 'expiration' value.
  # expiration: '1h'

  ## Cookie Session Domain default 'remember_me' value.
  # remember_me: '1M'
