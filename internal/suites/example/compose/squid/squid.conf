#	WELCOME TO SQUID 3.5.27
#	----------------------------
#	
#	This is the documentation for the Squid configuration file.
#	This documentation can also be found online at:
#		http://www.squid-cache.org/Doc/config/
#	
#	You may wish to look at the Squid home page and wiki for the
#	FAQ and other documentation:
#		http://www.squid-cache.org/
#		http://wiki.squid-cache.org/SquidFaq
#		http://wiki.squid-cache.org/ConfigExamples
#	
#	This documentation shows what the defaults for various directives
#	happen to be.  If you don't need to change the default, you should
#	leave the line out of your squid.conf in most cases.
#	
#	In some cases "none" refers to no default setting at all,
#	while in other cases it refers to the value of the option
#	- the comments for that keyword indicate if this is the case.
#

#  Configuration options can be included using the "include" directive.
#  Include takes a list of files to include. Quoting and wildcards are
#  supported.
#
#  For example,
#
#  include /path/to/included/file/squid.acl.config
#
#  Includes can be nested up to a hard-coded depth of 16 levels.
#  This arbitrary restriction is to prevent recursive include references
#  from causing Squid entering an infinite loop whilst trying to load
#  configuration files.
#
#  Values with byte units
#
#	Squid accepts size units on some size related directives. All
#	such directives are documented with a default value displaying
#	a unit.
#
#	Units accepted by Squid are:
#		bytes - byte
#		KB - Kilobyte (1024 bytes)
#		MB - Megabyte
#		GB - Gigabyte
#
#  Values with spaces, quotes, and other special characters
#
#	Squid supports directive parameters with spaces, quotes, and other
#	special characters. Surround such parameters with "double quotes". Use
#	the configuration_includes_quoted_values directive to enable or
#	disable that support.
#
#	Squid supports reading configuration option parameters from external
#	files using the syntax:
#		parameters("/path/filename")
#	For example:
#		acl whitelist dstdomain parameters("/etc/squid/whitelist.txt")
#
#  Conditional configuration
#
#	If-statements can be used to make configuration directives
#	depend on conditions:
#
#	    if <CONDITION>
#	        ... regular configuration directives ...
#	    [else
#	        ... regular configuration directives ...]
#	    endif
#
#	The else part is optional. The keywords "if", "else", and "endif"
#	must be typed on their own lines, as if they were regular
#	configuration directives.
#
#	NOTE: An else-if condition is not supported.
#
#	These individual conditions types are supported:
#
#	    true
#		Always evaluates to true.
#	    false
#		Always evaluates to false.
#	    <integer> = <integer>
#	        Equality comparison of two integer numbers.
#
#
#  SMP-Related Macros
#
#	The following SMP-related preprocessor macros can be used.
#
#	${process_name} expands to the current Squid process "name"
#	(e.g., squid1, squid2, or cache1).
#
#	${process_number} expands to the current Squid process
#	identifier, which is an integer number (e.g., 1, 2, 3) unique
#	across all Squid processes of the current service instance.
#
#	${service_name} expands into the current Squid service instance
#	name identifier which is provided by -n on the command line.

# OPTIONS FOR SMP
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

#  TAG: workers
#	Number of main Squid processes or "workers" to fork and maintain.
#	0: "no daemon" mode, like running "squid -N ..."
#	1: "no SMP" mode, start one main Squid process daemon (default)
#	N: start N main Squid process daemons (i.e., SMP mode)

#  TAG: cpu_affinity_map
#	Usage: cpu_affinity_map process_numbers=P1,P2,... cores=C1,C2,...
#
#	Sets 1:1 mapping between Squid processes and CPU cores. For example,
#
#	    cpu_affinity_map process_numbers=1,2,3,4 cores=1,3,5,7
#
#	affects processes 1 through 4 only and places them on the first
#	four even cores, starting with core #1.
#
#	CPU cores are numbered starting from 1. Requires support for
#	sched_getaffinity(2) and sched_setaffinity(2) system calls.
#
#	Multiple cpu_affinity_map options are merged.
#
#	See also: workers
#Default:
# Let operating system decide.

# OPTIONS FOR AUTHENTICATION
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

#  TAG: auth_param
#	This is used to define parameters for the various authentication
#	schemes supported by Squid.
#
#		format: auth_param scheme parameter [setting]
#
#	The order in which authentication schemes are presented to the client is
#	dependent on the order the scheme first appears in config file. IE
#	has a bug (it's not RFC 2617 compliant) in that it will use the basic
#	scheme if basic is the first entry presented, even if more secure
#	schemes are presented. For now use the order in the recommended
#	settings section below. If other browsers have difficulties (don't
#	recognize the schemes offered even if you are using basic) either
#	put basic first, or disable the other schemes (by commenting out their
#	program entry).
#
#	Once an authentication scheme is fully configured, it can only be
#	shutdown by shutting squid down and restarting. Changes can be made on
#	the fly and activated with a reconfigure. I.E. You can change to a
#	different helper, but not unconfigure the helper completely.
#
#	Please note that while this directive defines how Squid processes
#	authentication it does not automatically activate authentication.
#	To use authentication you must in addition make use of ACLs based
#	on login name in http_access (proxy_auth, proxy_auth_regex or
#	external with %LOGIN used in the format tag). The browser will be
#	challenged for authentication on the first such acl encountered
#	in http_access processing and will also be re-challenged for new
#	login credentials if the request is being denied by a proxy_auth
#	type acl.
#
#	WARNING: authentication can't be used in a transparently intercepting
#	proxy as the client then thinks it is talking to an origin server and
#	not the proxy. This is a limitation of bending the TCP/IP protocol to
#	transparently intercepting port 80, not a limitation in Squid.
#	Ports flagged 'transparent', 'intercept', or 'tproxy' have
#	authentication disabled.
#
#	=== Parameters common to all schemes. ===
#
#	"program" cmdline
#		Specifies the command for the external authenticator.
#
#		By default, each authentication scheme is not used unless a
#		program is specified.
#
#		See http://wiki.squid-cache.org/Features/AddonHelpers for
#		more details on helper operations and creating your own.
#
#	"key_extras" format
#		Specifies a string to be append to request line format for
#		the authentication helper. "Quoted" format values may contain
#		spaces and logformat %macros. In theory, any logformat %macro
#		can be used. In practice, a %macro expands as a dash (-) if
#		the helper request is sent before the required macro
#		information is available to Squid.
#
#		By default, Squid uses request formats provided in
#		scheme-specific examples below (search for %credentials).
#
#		The expanded key_extras value is added to the Squid credentials
#		cache and, hence, will affect authentication. It can be used to
#		autenticate different users with identical user names (e.g.,
#		when user authentication depends on http_port).
#
#		Avoid adding frequently changing information to key_extras. For
#		example, if you add user source IP, and it changes frequently
#		in your environment, then max_user_ip ACL is going to treat
#		every user+IP combination as a unique "user", breaking the ACL
#		and wasting a lot of memory on those user records. It will also
#		force users to authenticate from scratch whenever their IP
#		changes.
#
#	"realm" string
#		Specifies the protection scope (aka realm name) which is to be
#		reported to the client for the authentication scheme. It is
#		commonly part of the text the user will see when prompted for
#		their username and password.
#
#		For Basic the default is "Squid proxy-caching web server".
#		For Digest there is no default, this parameter is mandatory.
#		For NTLM and Negotiate this parameter is ignored.
#
#	"children" numberofchildren [startup=N] [idle=N] [concurrency=N]
#
#		The maximum number of authenticator processes to spawn. If
#		you start too few Squid will have to wait for them to process
#		a backlog of credential verifications, slowing it down. When
#		password verifications are done via a (slow) network you are
#		likely to need lots of authenticator processes.
#
#		The startup= and idle= options permit some skew in the exact
#		amount run. A minimum of startup=N will begin during startup
#		and reconfigure. Squid will start more in groups of up to
#		idle=N in an attempt to meet traffic needs and to keep idle=N
#		free above those traffic needs up to the maximum.
#
#		The concurrency= option sets the number of concurrent requests
#		the helper can process.  The default of 0 is used for helpers
#		who only supports one request at a time. Setting this to a
#		number greater than 0 changes the protocol used to include a
#		channel ID field first on the request/response line, allowing
#		multiple requests to be sent to the same helper in parallel
#		without waiting for the response.
#
#		Concurrency must not be set unless it's known the helper
#		supports the input format with channel-ID fields.
#
#		NOTE: NTLM and Negotiate schemes do not support concurrency
#			in the Squid code module even though some helpers can.
#
#
#
#	=== Example Configuration ===
#
#	This configuration displays the recommended authentication scheme
#	order from most to least secure with recommended minimum configuration
#	settings for each scheme:
#
##auth_param negotiate program <uncomment and complete this line to activate>
##auth_param negotiate children 20 startup=0 idle=1
##auth_param negotiate keep_alive on
##
##auth_param digest program <uncomment and complete this line to activate>
##auth_param digest children 20 startup=0 idle=1
##auth_param digest realm Squid proxy-caching web server
##auth_param digest nonce_garbage_interval 5 minutes
##auth_param digest nonce_max_duration 30 minutes
##auth_param digest nonce_max_count 50
##
##auth_param ntlm program <uncomment and complete this line to activate>
##auth_param ntlm children 20 startup=0 idle=1
##auth_param ntlm keep_alive on
##
##auth_param basic program <uncomment and complete this line>
##auth_param basic children 5 startup=5 idle=1
##auth_param basic realm Squid proxy-caching web server
##auth_param basic credentialsttl 2 hours
#Default:
# none

#  TAG: authenticate_cache_garbage_interval
#	The time period between garbage collection across the username cache.
#	This is a trade-off between memory utilization (long intervals - say
#	2 days) and CPU (short intervals - say 1 minute). Only change if you
#	have good reason to.
#Default:
# authenticate_cache_garbage_interval 1 hour

#  TAG: authenticate_ttl
#	The time a user & their credentials stay in the logged in
#	user cache since their last request. When the garbage
#	interval passes, all user credentials that have passed their
#	TTL are removed from memory.
#Default:
# authenticate_ttl 1 hour

#  TAG: authenticate_ip_ttl
#	If you use proxy authentication and the 'max_user_ip' ACL,
#	this directive controls how long Squid remembers the IP
#	addresses associated with each user.  Use a small value
#	(e.g., 60 seconds) if your users might change addresses
#	quickly, as is the case with dialup.   You might be safe
#	using a larger value (e.g., 2 hours) in a corporate LAN
#	environment with relatively static address assignments.
#Default:
# authenticate_ip_ttl 1 second

# ACCESS CONTROLS
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

#  TAG: external_acl_type
#	This option defines external acl classes using a helper program
#	to look up the status
#
#	  external_acl_type name [options] FORMAT.. /path/to/helper [helper arguments..]
#
#	Options:
#
#	  ttl=n		TTL in seconds for cached results (defaults to 3600
#	  		for 1 hour)
#
#	  negative_ttl=n
#	  		TTL for cached negative lookups (default same
#	  		as ttl)
#
#	  grace=n	Percentage remaining of TTL where a refresh of a
#			cached entry should be initiated without needing to
#			wait for a new reply. (default is for no grace period)
#
#	  cache=n	The maximum number of entries in the result cache. The
#			default limit is 262144 entries.  Each cache entry usually
#			consumes at least 256 bytes. Squid currently does not remove
#			expired cache entries until the limit is reached, so a proxy
#			will sooner or later reach the limit. The expanded FORMAT
#			value is used as the cache key, so if the details in FORMAT
#			are highly variable, a larger cache may be needed to produce
#			reduction in helper load.
#
#	  children-max=n
#			Maximum number of acl helper processes spawned to service
#			external acl lookups of this type. (default 5)
#
#	  children-startup=n
#			Minimum number of acl helper processes to spawn during
#			startup and reconfigure to service external acl lookups
#			of this type. (default 0)
#
#	  children-idle=n
#			Number of acl helper processes to keep ahead of traffic
#			loads. Squid will spawn this many at once whenever load
#			rises above the capabilities of existing processes.
#			Up to the value of children-max. (default 1)
#
#	  concurrency=n	concurrency level per process. Only used with helpers
#			capable of processing more than one query at a time.
#
#	  protocol=2.5	Compatibility mode for Squid-2.5 external acl helpers.
#
#	  ipv4 / ipv6	IP protocol used to communicate with this helper.
#			The default is to auto-detect IPv6 and use it when available.
#
#
#	FORMAT specifications
#
#	  %LOGIN	Authenticated user login name
#	  %un		A user name. Expands to the first available name
#	  		from the following list of information sources:
#			- authenticated user name, like %ul or %LOGIN
#			- user name sent by an external ACL, like %EXT_USER
#			- SSL client name, like %us in logformat
#			- ident user name, like %ui in logformat
#	  %EXT_USER	Username from previous external acl
#	  %EXT_LOG	Log details from previous external acl
#	  %EXT_TAG	Tag from previous external acl
#	  %IDENT	Ident user name
#	  %SRC		Client IP
#	  %SRCPORT	Client source port
#	  %URI		Requested URI
#	  %DST		Requested host
#	  %PROTO	Requested URL scheme
#	  %PORT		Requested port
#	  %PATH		Requested URL path
#	  %METHOD	Request method
#	  %MYADDR	Squid interface address
#	  %MYPORT	Squid http_port number
#	  %PATH		Requested URL-path (including query-string if any)
#	  %USER_CERT	SSL User certificate in PEM format
#	  %USER_CERTCHAIN SSL User certificate chain in PEM format
#	  %USER_CERT_xx	SSL User certificate subject attribute xx
#	  %USER_CA_CERT_xx SSL User certificate issuer attribute xx
#	  %ssl::>sni	SSL client SNI sent to Squid
#	  %ssl::<cert_subject SSL server certificate DN
#	  %ssl::<cert_issuer SSL server certificate issuer DN
#
#	  %>{Header}	HTTP request header "Header"
#	  %>{Hdr:member}
#	  		HTTP request header "Hdr" list member "member"
#	  %>{Hdr:;member}
#	  		HTTP request header list member using ; as
#	  		list separator. ; can be any non-alphanumeric
#			character.
#
#	  %<{Header}	HTTP reply header "Header"
#	  %<{Hdr:member}
#	  		HTTP reply header "Hdr" list member "member"
#	  %<{Hdr:;member}
#	  		HTTP reply header list member using ; as
#	  		list separator. ; can be any non-alphanumeric
#			character.
#
#	  %ACL		The name of the ACL being tested.
#	  %DATA		The ACL arguments. If not used then any arguments
#			is automatically added at the end of the line
#			sent to the helper.
#			NOTE: this will encode the arguments as one token,
#			whereas the default will pass each separately.
#
#	  %%		The percent sign. Useful for helpers which need
#			an unchanging input format.
#
#
#	General request syntax:
#
#	  [channel-ID] FORMAT-values [acl-values ...]
#
#
#	FORMAT-values consists of transaction details expanded with
#	whitespace separation per the config file FORMAT specification
#	using the FORMAT macros listed above.
#
#	acl-values consists of any string specified in the referencing
#	config 'acl ... external' line. see the "acl external" directive.
#
#	Request values sent to the helper are URL escaped to protect
#	each value in requests against whitespaces.
#
#	If using protocol=2.5 then the request sent to the helper is not
#	URL escaped to protect against whitespace.
#
#	NOTE: protocol=3.0 is deprecated as no longer necessary.
#
#	When using the concurrency= option the protocol is changed by
#	introducing a query channel tag in front of the request/response.
#	The query channel tag is a number between 0 and concurrency-1.
#	This value must be echoed back unchanged to Squid as the first part
#	of the response relating to its request.
#
#
#	The helper receives lines expanded per the above format specification
#	and for each input line returns 1 line starting with OK/ERR/BH result
#	code and optionally followed by additional keywords with more details.
#
#
#	General result syntax:
#
#	  [channel-ID] result keyword=value ...
#
#	Result consists of one of the codes:
#
#	  OK
#		the ACL test produced a match.
#
#	  ERR
#		the ACL test does not produce a match.
#
#	  BH
#		An internal error occurred in the helper, preventing
#		a result being identified.
#
#	The meaning of 'a match' is determined by your squid.conf
#	access control configuration. See the Squid wiki for details.
#
#	Defined keywords:
#
#	  user=		The users name (login)
#
#	  password=	The users password (for login= cache_peer option)
#
#	  message=	Message describing the reason for this response.
#			Available as %o in error pages.
#			Useful on (ERR and BH results).
#
#	  tag=		Apply a tag to a request. Only sets a tag once,
#			does not alter existing tags.
#
#	  log=		String to be logged in access.log. Available as
#	  		%ea in logformat specifications.
#
#  	  clt_conn_tag= Associates a TAG with the client TCP connection.
#			Please see url_rewrite_program related documentation
#			for this kv-pair.
#
#	Any keywords may be sent on any response whether OK, ERR or BH.
#
#	All response keyword values need to be a single token with URL
#	escaping, or enclosed in double quotes (") and escaped using \ on
#	any double quotes or \ characters within the value. The wrapping
#	double quotes are removed before the value is interpreted by Squid.
#	\r and \n are also replace by CR and LF.
#
#	Some example key values:
#
#		user=John%20Smith
#		user="John Smith"
#		user="J. \"Bob\" Smith"
#Default:
# none

#  TAG: acl
#	Defining an Access List
#
#	Every access list definition must begin with an aclname and acltype, 
#	followed by either type-specific arguments or a quoted filename that
#	they are read from.
#
#	   acl aclname acltype argument ...
#	   acl aclname acltype "file" ...
#
#	When using "file", the file should contain one item per line.
#
#	Some acl types supports options which changes their default behaviour.
#	The available options are:
#
#	-i,+i	By default, regular expressions are CASE-SENSITIVE. To make them
#		case-insensitive, use the -i option. To return case-sensitive
#		use the +i option between patterns, or make a new ACL line
#		without -i.	
#
#	-n	Disable lookups and address type conversions.  If lookup or
#		conversion is required because the parameter type (IP or
#		domain name) does not match the message address type (domain
#		name or IP), then the ACL would immediately declare a mismatch
#		without any warnings or lookups.
#
#	--	Used to stop processing all options, in the case the first acl
#		value has '-' character as first character (for example the '-'
#		is a valid domain name)
#
#	Some acl types require suspending the current request in order
#	to access some external data source.
#	Those which do are marked with the tag [slow], those which
#	don't are marked as [fast].
#	See http://wiki.squid-cache.org/SquidFaq/SquidAcl
#	for further information
#
#	***** ACL TYPES AVAILABLE *****
#
#	acl aclname src ip-address/mask ...	# clients IP address [fast]
#	acl aclname src addr1-addr2/mask ...	# range of addresses [fast]
#	acl aclname dst [-n] ip-address/mask ...	# URL host's IP address [slow]
#	acl aclname localip ip-address/mask ... # IP address the client connected to [fast]
#
#	acl aclname arp      mac-address ... (xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx notation)
#	  # [fast]
#	  # The 'arp' ACL code is not portable to all operating systems.
#	  # It works on Linux, Solaris, Windows, FreeBSD, and some other
#	  # BSD variants.
#	  #
#	  # NOTE: Squid can only determine the MAC/EUI address for IPv4
#	  # clients that are on the same subnet. If the client is on a
#	  # different subnet, then Squid cannot find out its address.
#	  #
#	  # NOTE 2: IPv6 protocol does not contain ARP. MAC/EUI is either
#	  # encoded directly in the IPv6 address or not available.
#
#	acl aclname srcdomain   .foo.com ...
#	  # reverse lookup, from client IP [slow]
#	acl aclname dstdomain [-n] .foo.com ...
#	  # Destination server from URL [fast]
#	acl aclname srcdom_regex [-i] \.foo\.com ...
#	  # regex matching client name [slow]
#	acl aclname dstdom_regex [-n] [-i] \.foo\.com ...
#	  # regex matching server [fast]
#	  #
#	  # For dstdomain and dstdom_regex a reverse lookup is tried if a IP
#	  # based URL is used and no match is found. The name "none" is used
#	  # if the reverse lookup fails.
#
#	acl aclname src_as number ...
#	acl aclname dst_as number ...
#	  # [fast]
#	  # Except for access control, AS numbers can be used for

#	  # example for routing all requests for AS#1241 and only
#	  # those to mycache.mydomain.net:
#	  # acl asexample dst_as 1241
#	  # cache_peer_access mycache.mydomain.net allow asexample

#  TAG: proxy_protocol_access
#	Determine which client proxies can be trusted to provide correct
#	information regarding real client IP address using PROXY protocol.
#
#	Requests may pass through a chain of several other proxies
#	before reaching us. The original source details may by sent in:
#		* HTTP message Forwarded header, or
#		* HTTP message X-Forwarded-For header, or
#		* PROXY protocol connection header.
#
#	This directive is solely for validating new PROXY protocol
#	connections received from a port flagged with require-proxy-header.
#	It is checked only once after TCP connection setup.
#
#	A deny match results in TCP connection closure.
#
#	An allow match is required for Squid to permit the corresponding
#	TCP connection, before Squid even looks for HTTP request headers.
#	If there is an allow match, Squid starts using PROXY header information
#	to determine the source address of the connection for all future ACL
#	checks, logging, etc.
#
#	SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS:
#
#		Any host from which we accept client IP details can place
#		incorrect information in the relevant header, and Squid
#		will use the incorrect information as if it were the
#		source address of the request.  This may enable remote
#		hosts to bypass any access control restrictions that are
#		based on the client's source addresses.
#
#	This clause only supports fast acl types.
#	See http://wiki.squid-cache.org/SquidFaq/SquidAcl for details.
#Default:
# all TCP connections to ports with require-proxy-header will be denied

#  TAG: follow_x_forwarded_for
#	Determine which client proxies can be trusted to provide correct
#	information regarding real client IP address.
#
#	Requests may pass through a chain of several other proxies
#	before reaching us. The original source details may by sent in:
#		* HTTP message Forwarded header, or
#		* HTTP message X-Forwarded-For header, or
#		* PROXY protocol connection header.
#
#	PROXY protocol connections are controlled by the proxy_protocol_access
#	directive which is checked before this.
#
#	If a request reaches us from a source that is allowed by this
#	directive, then we trust the information it provides regarding
#	the IP of the client it received from (if any).
#
#	For the purpose of ACLs used in this directive the src ACL type always
#	matches the address we are testing and srcdomain matches its rDNS.
#
#	On each HTTP request Squid checks for X-Forwarded-For header fields.
#	If found the header values are iterated in reverse order and an allow
#	match is required for Squid to continue on to the next value.
#	The verification ends when a value receives a deny match, cannot be
#	tested, or there are no more values to test.
#	NOTE: Squid does not yet follow the Forwarded HTTP header.
#
#	The end result of this process is an IP address that we will
#	refer to as the indirect client address.  This address may
#	be treated as the client address for access control, ICAP, delay
#	pools and logging, depending on the acl_uses_indirect_client,
#	icap_uses_indirect_client, delay_pool_uses_indirect_client, 
#	log_uses_indirect_client and tproxy_uses_indirect_client options.
#
#	This clause only supports fast acl types.
#	See http://wiki.squid-cache.org/SquidFaq/SquidAcl for details.
#
#	SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS:
#
#		Any host from which we accept client IP details can place
#		incorrect information in the relevant header, and Squid
#		will use the incorrect information as if it were the
#		source address of the request.  This may enable remote
#		hosts to bypass any access control restrictions that are
#		based on the client's source addresses.
#
#	For example:
#
#		acl localhost src 127.0.0.1
#		acl my_other_proxy srcdomain .proxy.example.com
#		follow_x_forwarded_for allow localhost
#		follow_x_forwarded_for allow my_other_proxy
#Default:

#  TAG: acl_uses_indirect_client	on|off
#	Controls whether the indirect client address
#	(see follow_x_forwarded_for) is used instead of the
#	direct client address in acl matching.
#
#	NOTE: maxconn ACL considers direct TCP links and indirect
#	      clients will always have zero. So no match.
#Default:
# acl_uses_indirect_client on

#  TAG: delay_pool_uses_indirect_client	on|off
#	Controls whether the indirect client address
#	(see follow_x_forwarded_for) is used instead of the
#	direct client address in delay pools.
#Default:
# delay_pool_uses_indirect_client on

#  TAG: log_uses_indirect_client	on|off
#	Controls whether the indirect client address

#  TAG: http_access
#	Allowing or Denying access based on defined access lists
#
#	To allow or deny a message received on an HTTP, HTTPS, or FTP port:
#	http_access allow|deny [!]aclname ...
#
#	NOTE on default values:
#
#	If there are no "access" lines present, the default is to deny
#	the request.
#
#	If none of the "access" lines cause a match, the default is the
#	opposite of the last line in the list.  If the last line was
#	deny, the default is allow.  Conversely, if the last line
#	is allow, the default will be deny.  For these reasons, it is a
#	good idea to have an "deny all" entry at the end of your access
#	lists to avoid potential confusion.
#
#	This clause supports both fast and slow acl types.
#	See http://wiki.squid-cache.org/SquidFaq/SquidAcl for details.
#
#Default:

#	Allow replies to client requests. This is complementary to http_access.
#
#	http_reply_access allow|deny [!] aclname ...
#
#	NOTE: if there are no access lines present, the default is to allow

#
#	If none of the access lines cause a match the opposite of the

#	    a parent.
#
#		acl localclients src 192.0.2.0/24 2001:DB8::a:0/64
#		miss_access deny  !localclients
#		miss_access allow all
#
#	This means only your local clients are allowed to fetch relayed/MISS
#	replies from the network and all other clients can only fetch cached
#	objects (HITs).
#
#	The default for this setting allows all clients who passed the
#	http_access rules to relay via this proxy.
#
#	This clause only supports fast acl types.
#	See http://wiki.squid-cache.org/SquidFaq/SquidAcl for details.
#Default:
# Allow, unless rules exist in squid.conf.

#  TAG: ident_lookup_access
#	A list of ACL elements which, if matched, cause an ident
#	(RFC 931) lookup to be performed for this request.  For
#	example, you might choose to always perform ident lookups
#	for your main multi-user Unix boxes, but not for your Macs
#	and PCs.  By default, ident lookups are not performed for
#	any requests.
#
#	To enable ident lookups for specific client addresses, you
#	can follow this example:
#
#	acl ident_aware_hosts src 198.168.1.0/24
#	ident_lookup_access allow ident_aware_hosts
#	ident_lookup_access deny all
#
#	Only src type ACL checks are fully supported.  A srcdomain
#	ACL might work at times, but it will not always provide
#	the correct result.
#
#	This clause only supports fast acl types.
#	See http://wiki.squid-cache.org/SquidFaq/SquidAcl for details.
#Default:
# Unless rules exist in squid.conf, IDENT is not fetched.

#  TAG: reply_body_max_size	size [acl acl...]
#	This option specifies the maximum size of a reply body. It can be
#	used to prevent users from downloading very large files, such as
#	MP3's and movies. When the reply headers are received, the
#	reply_body_max_size lines are processed, and the first line where
#	all (if any) listed ACLs are true is used as the maximum body size
#	for this reply.
#
#	This size is checked twice. First when we get the reply headers,
#	we check the content-length value.  If the content length value exists
#	and is larger than the allowed size, the request is denied and the
#	user receives an error message that says "the request or reply
#	is too large." If there is no content-length, and the reply
#	size exceeds this limit, the client's connection is just closed
#	and they will receive a partial reply.
#
#	WARNING: downstream caches probably can not detect a partial reply
#	if there is no content-length header, so they will cache
#	partial responses and give them out as hits.  You should NOT
#	use this option if you have downstream caches.
#
#	WARNING: A maximum size smaller than the size of squid's error messages
#	will cause an infinite loop and crash squid. Ensure that the smallest
#	non-zero value you use is greater that the maximum header size plus
#	the size of your largest error page.
#
#	If you set this parameter none (the default), there will be
#	no limit imposed.
#
#	Configuration Format is:
#		reply_body_max_size SIZE UNITS [acl ...]
#	ie.
#		reply_body_max_size 10 MB
#
#Default:
# No limit is applied.

# NETWORK OPTIONS
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

#  TAG: http_port
#	Usage:	port [mode] [options]
#		hostname:port [mode] [options]
#		1.2.3.4:port [mode] [options]
#
#	The socket addresses where Squid will listen for HTTP client
#	requests.  You may specify multiple socket addresses.
#	There are three forms: port alone, hostname with port, and
#	IP address with port.  If you specify a hostname or IP
#	address, Squid binds the socket to that specific
#	address. Most likely, you do not need to bind to a specific
#	address, so you can use the port number alone.
#
#	If you are running Squid in accelerator mode, you
#	probably want to listen on port 80 also, or instead.
#
#	The -a command line option may be used to specify additional
#	port(s) where Squid listens for proxy request. Such ports will
#	be plain proxy ports with no options.
#
#	You may specify multiple socket addresses on multiple lines.
#
#	Modes:
#
#	   intercept	Support for IP-Layer NAT interception delivering
#			traffic to this Squid port.
#			NP: disables authentication on the port.
#
#	   tproxy	Support Linux TPROXY (or BSD divert-to) with spoofing
#			of outgoing connections using the client IP address.
#			NP: disables authentication on the port.
#
#	   accel	Accelerator / reverse proxy mode
#
#	   ssl-bump	For each CONNECT request allowed by ssl_bump ACLs,
#			establish secure connection with the client and with
#			the server, decrypt HTTPS messages as they pass through
#			Squid, and treat them as unencrypted HTTP messages,
#			becoming the man-in-the-middle.
#
#			The ssl_bump option is required to fully enable
#			bumping of CONNECT requests.
#
#	Omitting the mode flag causes default forward proxy mode to be used.

#  TAG: ftp_port
#	Enables Native FTP proxy by specifying the socket address where Squid
#	listens for FTP client requests. See http_port directive for various
#	ways to specify the listening address and mode.
#
#	Usage: ftp_port address [mode] [options]
#
#	WARNING: This is a new, experimental, complex feature that has seen
#	limited production exposure. Some Squid modules (e.g., caching) do not
#	currently work with native FTP proxying, and many features have not
#	even been tested for compatibility. Test well before deploying!
#
#	Native FTP proxying differs substantially from proxying HTTP requests
#	with ftp:// URIs because Squid works as an FTP server and receives
#	actual FTP commands (rather than HTTP requests with FTP URLs).
#
#	Native FTP commands accepted at ftp_port are internally converted or
#	wrapped into HTTP-like messages. The same happens to Native FTP
#	responses received from FTP origin servers. Those HTTP-like messages
#	are shoveled through regular access control and adaptation layers
#	between the FTP client and the FTP origin server. This allows Squid to
#	examine, adapt, block, and log FTP exchanges. Squid reuses most HTTP
#	mechanisms when shoveling wrapped FTP messages. For example,
#	http_access and adaptation_access directives are used.
#
#	Modes:
#
#	   intercept	Same as http_port intercept. The FTP origin address is
#			determined based on the intended destination of the
#			intercepted connection.
#
#	   tproxy	Support Linux TPROXY for spoofing outgoing
#			connections using the client IP address.
#			NP: disables authentication and maybe IPv6 on the port.
#
#	By default (i.e., without an explicit mode option), Squid extracts the
#	FTP origin address from the login@origin parameter of the FTP USER
#	command. Many popular FTP clients support such native FTP proxying.
#
#	Options:
#
#	   name=token	Specifies an internal name for the port. Defaults to
#			the port address. Usable with myportname ACL.
#
#	   ftp-track-dirs
#			Enables tracking of FTP directories by injecting extra
#			PWD commands and adjusting Request-URI (in wrapping
#			HTTP requests) to reflect the current FTP server
#			directory. Tracking is disabled by default.
#
#	   protocol=FTP	Protocol to reconstruct accelerated and intercepted
#			requests with. Defaults to FTP. No other accepted
#			values have been tested with. An unsupported value
#			results in a FATAL error. Accepted values are FTP,
#			HTTP (or HTTP/1.1), and HTTPS (or HTTPS/1.1).
#
#	Other http_port modes and options that are not specific to HTTP and
#	HTTPS may also work.
#Default:
# none

#  TAG: tcp_outgoing_tos
#	Allows you to select a TOS/Diffserv value for packets outgoing
#	on the server side, based on an ACL.
#
#	tcp_outgoing_tos ds-field [!]aclname ...

#	RFC2475, and RFC3260.
#
#	The TOS/DSCP byte must be exactly that - a octet value  0 - 255, or
#	"default" to use whatever default your host has.
#	Note that only multiples of 4 are usable as the two rightmost bits have
#	been redefined for use by ECN (RFC 3168 section 23.1).
#	The squid parser will enforce this by masking away the ECN bits.
#
#	Processing proceeds in the order specified, and stops at first fully
#	matching line.
#
#	Only fast ACLs are supported.
#Default:
# none

#  TAG: clientside_tos
#	Allows you to select a TOS/DSCP value for packets being transmitted
#	on the client-side, based on an ACL.

#Default:
# none

#  TAG: qos_flows
#	Allows you to select a TOS/DSCP value to mark outgoing
#	connections to the client, based on where the reply was sourced.
#	For platforms using netfilter, allows you to set a netfilter mark
#	value instead of, or in addition to, a TOS value.
#
#	By default this functionality is disabled. To enable it with the default
#	settings simply use "qos_flows mark" or "qos_flows tos". Default
#	settings will result in the netfilter mark or TOS value being copied
#	from the upstream connection to the client. Note that it is the connection
#	CONNMARK value not the packet MARK value that is copied.
#
#	It is not currently possible to copy the mark or TOS value from the
#	client to the upstream connection request.
#
#	TOS values really only have local significance - so you should
#	know what you're specifying. For more information, see RFC2474,
#	RFC2475, and RFC3260.
#
#	The TOS/DSCP byte must be exactly that - a octet value  0 - 255.
#	Note that only multiples of 4 are usable as the two rightmost bits have
#	been redefined for use by ECN (RFC 3168 section 23.1).
#	The squid parser will enforce this by masking away the ECN bits.
#
#	Mark values can be any unsigned 32-bit integer value.
#
#	This setting is configured by setting the following values:
#
#	tos|mark                Whether to set TOS or netfilter mark values
#
#	local-hit=0xFF		Value to mark local cache hits.
#
#	sibling-hit=0xFF	Value to mark hits from sibling peers.
#
#	parent-hit=0xFF		Value to mark hits from parent peers.
#
#	miss=0xFF[/mask]	Value to mark cache misses. Takes precedence
#				over the preserve-miss feature (see below), unless
#				mask is specified, in which case only the bits
#				specified in the mask are written.
#
#	The TOS variant of the following features are only possible on Linux
#	and require your kernel to be patched with the TOS preserving ZPH
#	patch, available from http://zph.bratcheda.org
#	No patch is needed to preserve the netfilter mark, which will work
#	with all variants of netfilter.
#
#	disable-preserve-miss
#		This option disables the preservation of the TOS or netfilter
#		mark. By default, the existing TOS or netfilter mark value of
#		the response coming from the remote server will be retained
#		and masked with miss-mark.
#		NOTE: in the case of a netfilter mark, the mark must be set on
#		the connection (using the CONNMARK target) not on the packet
#		(MARK target).
#
#	miss-mask=0xFF
#		Allows you to mask certain bits in the TOS or mark value
#		received from the remote server, before copying the value to
#		the TOS sent towards clients.
#		Default for tos: 0xFF (TOS from server is not changed).
#		Default for mark: 0xFFFFFFFF (mark from server is not changed).
#
#	All of these features require the --enable-zph-qos compilation flag
#	(enabled by default). Netfilter marking also requires the
#	libnetfilter_conntrack libraries (--with-netfilter-conntrack) and
#	libcap 2.09+ (--with-libcap).
#
#Default:
# none

#  TAG: tcp_outgoing_address
#	Allows you to map requests to different outgoing IP addresses
#	based on the username or source address of the user making
#	the request.
#
#	tcp_outgoing_address ipaddr [[!]aclname] ...
#
#	For example;
#		Forwarding clients with dedicated IPs for certain subnets.
#
#	  acl normal_service_net src 10.0.0.0/24
#	  acl good_service_net src 10.0.2.0/24

#	  tcp_outgoing_address 2001:db8::c001 good_service_net
#	  tcp_outgoing_address 10.1.0.2 good_service_net
#
#	  tcp_outgoing_address 2001:db8::beef normal_service_net
#	  tcp_outgoing_address 10.1.0.1 normal_service_net
#
#	  tcp_outgoing_address 2001:db8::1
#	  tcp_outgoing_address 10.1.0.3
#
#	Processing proceeds in the order specified, and stops at first fully
#	matching line.
#
#	Squid will add an implicit IP version test to each line.
#	Requests going to IPv4 websites will use the outgoing 10.1.0.* addresses.
#	Requests going to IPv6 websites will use the outgoing 2001:db8:* addresses.
#
#
#	NOTE: The use of this directive using client dependent ACLs is
#	incompatible with the use of server side persistent connections. To
#	ensure correct results it is best to set server_persistent_connections
#	to off when using this directive in such configurations.
#
#	NOTE: The use of this directive to set a local IP on outgoing TCP links
#	is incompatible with using TPROXY to set client IP out outbound TCP links.
#	When needing to contact peers use the no-tproxy cache_peer option and the
#	client_dst_passthru directive re-enable normal forwarding such as this.
#
#Default:
# Address selection is performed by the operating system.

#  TAG: host_verify_strict
#	Regardless of this option setting, when dealing with intercepted
#	traffic, Squid always verifies that the destination IP address matches
#	the Host header domain or IP (called 'authority form URL').
#	
#	This enforcement is performed to satisfy a MUST-level requirement in
#	RFC 2616 section 14.23: "The Host field value MUST represent the naming
#	authority of the origin server or gateway given by the original URL".
#	
#	When set to ON:
#		Squid always responds with an HTTP 409 (Conflict) error
#		page and logs a security warning if there is no match.
#	
#		Squid verifies that the destination IP address matches
#		the Host header for forward-proxy and reverse-proxy traffic
#		as well. For those traffic types, Squid also enables the
#		following checks, comparing the corresponding Host header
#		and Request-URI components:
#	
#		 * The host names (domain or IP) must be identical,
#		   but valueless or missing Host header disables all checks.
#		   For the two host names to match, both must be either IP
#		   or FQDN.
#	
#		 * Port numbers must be identical, but if a port is missing
#		   the scheme-default port is assumed.
#	
#	
#	When set to OFF (the default):
#		Squid allows suspicious requests to continue but logs a
#		security warning and blocks caching of the response.
#	
#		 * Forward-proxy traffic is not checked at all.
#	
#		 * Reverse-proxy traffic is not checked at all.
#	
#		 * Intercepted traffic which passes verification is handled
#		   according to client_dst_passthru.
#	
#		 * Intercepted requests which fail verification are sent
#		   to the client original destination instead of DIRECT.
#		   This overrides 'client_dst_passthru off'.
#	
#		For now suspicious intercepted CONNECT requests are always
#		responded to with an HTTP 409 (Conflict) error page.
#	
#	
#	SECURITY NOTE:
#	
#	As described in CVE-2009-0801 when the Host: header alone is used
#	to determine the destination of a request it becomes trivial for
#	malicious scripts on remote websites to bypass browser same-origin
#	security policy and sandboxing protections.
#	
#	The cause of this is that such applets are allowed to perform their
#	own HTTP stack, in which case the same-origin policy of the browser
#	sandbox only verifies that the applet tries to contact the same IP
#	as from where it was loaded at the IP level. The Host: header may
#	be different from the connected IP and approved origin.
#	
#Default:
# host_verify_strict off

#  TAG: client_dst_passthru
#	With NAT or TPROXY intercepted traffic Squid may pass the request
#	directly to the original client destination IP or seek a faster
#	source using the HTTP Host header.
#	
#	Using Host to locate alternative servers can provide faster
#	connectivity with a range of failure recovery options.
#	But can also lead to connectivity trouble when the client and
#	server are attempting stateful interactions unaware of the proxy.
#	
#	This option (on by default) prevents alternative DNS entries being
#	located to send intercepted traffic DIRECT to an origin server.
#	The clients original destination IP and port will be used instead.
#	
#	Regardless of this option setting, when dealing with intercepted
#	traffic Squid will verify the Host: header and any traffic which
#	fails Host verification will be treated as if this option were ON.
#	
#	see host_verify_strict for details on the verification process.

#  TAG: ssl_bump
# Note: This option is only available if Squid is rebuilt with the

#
#	This option is consulted when a CONNECT request is received on

#	https_port), provided that port was configured with an ssl-bump
#	flag. The subsequent data on the connection is either treated as
#	HTTPS and decrypted OR tunneled at TCP level without decryption,
#	depending on the first matching bumping "action".
#
#	ssl_bump <action> [!]acl ...
#
#	The following bumping actions are currently supported:
#
#	    splice
#		Become a TCP tunnel without decrypting proxied traffic.
#		This is the default action.
#
#	    bump
#		When used on step SslBump1, establishes a secure connection
#		with the client first, then connect to the server.
#		When used on step SslBump2 or SslBump3, establishes a secure
#		connection with the server and, using a mimicked server
#		certificate, with the client.
#
#	    peek
#		Receive client (step SslBump1) or server (step SslBump2)
#		certificate while preserving the possibility of splicing the
#		connection. Peeking at the server certificate (during step 2)
#		usually precludes bumping of the connection at step 3.
#
#	    stare
#		Receive client (step SslBump1) or server (step SslBump2)
#		certificate while preserving the possibility of bumping the
#		connection. Staring at the server certificate (during step 2)
#		usually precludes splicing of the connection at step 3.
#
#	    terminate
#		Close client and server connections.
#
#	Backward compatibility actions available at step SslBump1:
#
#	    client-first
#		Bump the connection. Establish a secure connection with the
#		client first, then connect to the server. This old mode does
#		not allow Squid to mimic server SSL certificate and does not
#		work with intercepted SSL connections.
#
#	    server-first
#		Bump the connection. Establish a secure connection with the
#		server first, then establish a secure connection with the
#		client, using a mimicked server certificate. Works with both
#		CONNECT requests and intercepted SSL connections, but does
#		not allow to make decisions based on SSL handshake info.
#
#	    peek-and-splice
#		Decide whether to bump or splice the connection based on 
#		client-to-squid and server-to-squid SSL hello messages.
#		XXX: Remove.
#
#	    none
#		Same as the "splice" action.
#
#	All ssl_bump rules are evaluated at each of the supported bumping
#	steps.  Rules with actions that are impossible at the current step are
#	ignored. The first matching ssl_bump action wins and is applied at the
#	end of the current step. If no rules match, the splice action is used.
#	See the at_step ACL for a list of the supported SslBump steps.

#
#	SQUID_X509_V_ERR_INFINITE_VALIDATION error cannot be bypassed
#	but should not happen unless your OpenSSL library is buggy.
#
#	SECURITY WARNING:
#		Bypassing validation errors is dangerous because an

#
#
#        sslproxy_cert_sign <signing algorithm> acl ...
#
#        The following certificate signing algorithms are supported:
#
#	   signTrusted
#		Sign using the configured CA certificate which is usually
#		placed in and trusted by end-user browsers. This is the
#		default for trusted origin server certificates.
#
#	   signUntrusted
#		Sign to guarantee an X509_V_ERR_CERT_UNTRUSTED browser error.
#		This is the default for untrusted origin server certificates
#		that are not self-signed (see ssl::certUntrusted).
#
#	   signSelf
#		Sign using a self-signed certificate with the right CN to
#		generate a X509_V_ERR_DEPTH_ZERO_SELF_SIGNED_CERT error in the
#		browser. This is the default for self-signed origin server
#		certificates (see ssl::certSelfSigned).
#
#	This clause only supports fast acl types.
#
#	When sslproxy_cert_sign acl(s) match, Squid uses the corresponding
#	signing algorithm to generate the certificate and ignores all
#	subsequent sslproxy_cert_sign options (the first match wins). If no
#	acl(s) match, the default signing algorithm is determined by errors
#	detected when obtaining and validating the origin server certificate.
#
#	WARNING: SQUID_X509_V_ERR_DOMAIN_MISMATCH and ssl:certDomainMismatch can
#	be used with sslproxy_cert_adapt, but if and only if Squid is bumping a
#	CONNECT request that carries a domain name. In all other cases (CONNECT

#
#	   setValidAfter
#		Sets the "Not After" property to the "Not After" property of
#		the CA certificate used to sign generated certificates.
#
#	   setValidBefore
#		Sets the "Not Before" property to the "Not Before" property of
#		the CA certificate used to sign generated certificates.
#
#	   setCommonName or setCommonName{CN}
#		Sets Subject.CN property to the host name specified as a 
#		CN parameter or, if no explicit CN parameter was specified,
#		extracted from the CONNECT request. It is a misconfiguration
#		to use setCommonName without an explicit parameter for
#		intercepted or tproxied SSL connections.
#		
#	This clause only supports fast acl types.
#
#	Squid first groups sslproxy_cert_adapt options by adaptation algorithm.
#	Within a group, when sslproxy_cert_adapt acl(s) match, Squid uses the
#	corresponding adaptation algorithm to generate the certificate and
#	ignores all subsequent sslproxy_cert_adapt options in that algorithm's
#	group (i.e., the first match wins within each algorithm group). If no
#	acl(s) match, the default mimicking action takes place.
#
#	WARNING: SQUID_X509_V_ERR_DOMAIN_MISMATCH and ssl:certDomainMismatch can

#	cache_peer cdn.example.com      sibling   3128     0  
#	
#	      type:	either 'parent', 'sibling', or 'multicast'.
#	
#	proxy-port:	The port number where the peer accept HTTP requests.
#			For other Squid proxies this is usually 3128
#			For web servers this is usually 80
#	
#	  icp-port:	Used for querying neighbor caches about objects.
#			Set to 0 if the peer does not support ICP or HTCP.
#			See ICP and HTCP options below for additional details.
#	
#	
#	==== ICP OPTIONS ====
#	
#	You MUST also set icp_port and icp_access explicitly when using these options.
#	The defaults will prevent peer traffic using ICP.
#	
#	
#	no-query	Disable ICP queries to this neighbor.
#	
#	multicast-responder
#			Indicates the named peer is a member of a multicast group.
#			ICP queries will not be sent directly to the peer, but ICP
#			replies will be accepted from it.
#	
#	closest-only	Indicates that, for ICP_OP_MISS replies, we'll only forward
#			CLOSEST_PARENT_MISSes and never FIRST_PARENT_MISSes.
#	
#	background-ping
#			To only send ICP queries to this neighbor infrequently.
#			This is used to keep the neighbor round trip time updated
#			and is usually used in conjunction with weighted-round-robin.
#	
#	
#	==== HTCP OPTIONS ====
#	
#	You MUST also set htcp_port and htcp_access explicitly when using these options.
#	The defaults will prevent peer traffic using HTCP.
#	
#	
#	htcp		Send HTCP, instead of ICP, queries to the neighbor.
#			You probably also want to set the "icp-port" to 4827
#			instead of 3130. This directive accepts a comma separated
#			list of options described below.
#	
#	htcp=oldsquid	Send HTCP to old Squid versions (2.5 or earlier).
#	
#	htcp=no-clr	Send HTCP to the neighbor but without
#			sending any CLR requests.  This cannot be used with
#			only-clr.
#	
#	htcp=only-clr	Send HTCP to the neighbor but ONLY CLR requests.
#			This cannot be used with no-clr.
#	
#	htcp=no-purge-clr
#			Send HTCP to the neighbor including CLRs but only when
#			they do not result from PURGE requests.
#	
#	htcp=forward-clr
#			Forward any HTCP CLR requests this proxy receives to the peer.
#	
#	
#	==== PEER SELECTION METHODS ====
#	
#	The default peer selection method is ICP, with the first responding peer
#	being used as source. These options can be used for better load balancing.
#	
#	
#	default		This is a parent cache which can be used as a "last-resort"
#			if a peer cannot be located by any of the peer-selection methods.
#			If specified more than once, only the first is used.
#	
#	round-robin	Load-Balance parents which should be used in a round-robin
#			fashion in the absence of any ICP queries.
#			weight=N can be used to add bias.
#	
#	weighted-round-robin
#			Load-Balance parents which should be used in a round-robin
#			fashion with the frequency of each parent being based on the
#			round trip time. Closer parents are used more often.
#			Usually used for background-ping parents.
#			weight=N can be used to add bias.
#	
#	carp		Load-Balance parents which should be used as a CARP array.
#			The requests will be distributed among the parents based on the
#			CARP load balancing hash function based on their weight.
#	
#	userhash	Load-balance parents based on the client proxy_auth or ident username.
#	
#	sourcehash	Load-balance parents based on the client source IP.
#
#	multicast-siblings
#			To be used only for cache peers of type "multicast".
#			ALL members of this multicast group have "sibling"
#			relationship with it, not "parent".  This is to a multicast
#			group when the requested object would be fetched only from
#			a "parent" cache, anyway.  It's useful, e.g., when
#			configuring a pool of redundant Squid proxies, being
#			members of the same multicast group.
#	
#	
#	==== PEER SELECTION OPTIONS ====
#	
#	weight=N	use to affect the selection of a peer during any weighted
#			peer-selection mechanisms.
#			The weight must be an integer; default is 1,
#			larger weights are favored more.
#			This option does not affect parent selection if a peering
#			protocol is not in use.
#	
#	basetime=N	Specify a base amount to be subtracted from round trip
#			times of parents.
#			It is subtracted before division by weight in calculating
#			which parent to fectch from. If the rtt is less than the
#			base time the rtt is set to a minimal value.
#	
#	ttl=N		Specify a TTL to use when sending multicast ICP queries
#			to this address.
#			Only useful when sending to a multicast group.
#			Because we don't accept ICP replies from random
#			hosts, you must configure other group members as
#			peers with the 'multicast-responder' option.
#	
#	no-delay	To prevent access to this neighbor from influencing the
#			delay pools.
#	
#	digest-url=URL	Tell Squid to fetch the cache digest (if digests are
#			enabled) for this host from the specified URL rather
#			than the Squid default location.
#	
#	
#	==== CARP OPTIONS ====
#	
#	carp-key=key-specification
#			use a different key than the full URL to hash against the peer.
#			the key-specification is a comma-separated list of the keywords			
#			scheme, host, port, path, params
#			Order is not important.
#	
#	==== ACCELERATOR / REVERSE-PROXY OPTIONS ====
#	
#	originserver	Causes this parent to be contacted as an origin server.
#			Meant to be used in accelerator setups when the peer
#			is a web server.
#	
#	forceddomain=name
#			Set the Host header of requests forwarded to this peer.
#			Useful in accelerator setups where the server (peer)
#			expects a certain domain name but clients may request
#			others. ie example.com or www.example.com
#	
#	no-digest	Disable request of cache digests.
#	
#	no-netdb-exchange
#			Disables requesting ICMP RTT database (NetDB).
#	
#	
#	==== AUTHENTICATION OPTIONS ====
#	
#	login=user:password
#			If this is a personal/workgroup proxy and your parent
#			requires proxy authentication.
#			
#			Note: The string can include URL escapes (i.e. %20 for
#			spaces). This also means % must be written as %%.
#	
#	login=PASSTHRU
#			Send login details received from client to this peer.
#			Both Proxy- and WWW-Authorization headers are passed
#			without alteration to the peer.
#			Authentication is not required by Squid for this to work.
#			
#			Note: This will pass any form of authentication but
#			only Basic auth will work through a proxy unless the
#			connection-auth options are also used.
#
#	login=PASS	Send login details received from client to this peer.
#			Authentication is not required by this option.
#			
#			If there are no client-provided authentication headers
#			to pass on, but username and password are available
#			from an external ACL user= and password= result tags
#			they may be sent instead.
#			
#			Note: To combine this with proxy_auth both proxies must
#			share the same user database as HTTP only allows for
#			a single login (one for proxy, one for origin server).
#			Also be warned this will expose your users proxy
#			password to the peer. USE WITH CAUTION
#	
#	login=*:password
#			Send the username to the upstream cache, but with a
#			fixed password. This is meant to be used when the peer
#			is in another administrative domain, but it is still
#			needed to identify each user.
#			The star can optionally be followed by some extra
#			information which is added to the username. This can
#			be used to identify this proxy to the peer, similar to
#			the login=username:password option above.
#	
#	login=NEGOTIATE
#			If this is a personal/workgroup proxy and your parent
#			requires a secure proxy authentication.
#			The first principal from the default keytab or defined by
#			the environment variable KRB5_KTNAME will be used. 
#	
#			WARNING: The connection may transmit requests from multiple
#			clients. Negotiate often assumes end-to-end authentication
#			and a single-client. Which is not strictly true here.
#	
#	login=NEGOTIATE:principal_name
#			If this is a personal/workgroup proxy and your parent
#			requires a secure proxy authentication. 
#			The principal principal_name from the default keytab or
#			defined by the environment variable KRB5_KTNAME will be
#			used.
#	
#			WARNING: The connection may transmit requests from multiple
#			clients. Negotiate often assumes end-to-end authentication
#			and a single-client. Which is not strictly true here.
#	
#	connection-auth=on|off
#			Tell Squid that this peer does or not support Microsoft
#			connection oriented authentication, and any such
#			challenges received from there should be ignored.
#			Default is auto to automatically determine the status
#			of the peer.
#	
#	
#	==== SSL / HTTPS / TLS OPTIONS ====
#	
#	ssl		Encrypt connections to this peer with SSL/TLS.
#	
#	sslcert=/path/to/ssl/certificate
#			A client SSL certificate to use when connecting to
#			this peer.
#	
#	sslkey=/path/to/ssl/key
#			The private SSL key corresponding to sslcert above.
#			If 'sslkey' is not specified 'sslcert' is assumed to
#			reference a combined file containing both the
#			certificate and the key.
#
#	Notes:
#	
#	On Debian/Ubuntu systems a default snakeoil certificate is
#    available in /etc/ssl and users can set:
#
#		cert=/etc/ssl/certs/ssl-cert-snakeoil.pem
#
#	and
#
#		key=/etc/ssl/private/ssl-cert-snakeoil.key
#
#	for testing.
#	
#	sslversion=1|2|3|4|5|6
#			The SSL version to use when connecting to this peer
#				1 = automatic (default)
#				2 = SSL v2 only
#				3 = SSL v3 only
#				4 = TLS v1.0 only
#				5 = TLS v1.1 only
#				6 = TLS v1.2 only
#	
#	sslcipher=...	The list of valid SSL ciphers to use when connecting
#			to this peer.
#	
#	ssloptions=... 	Specify various SSL implementation options:
#
#			    NO_SSLv2    Disallow the use of SSLv2
#			    NO_SSLv3    Disallow the use of SSLv3
#			    NO_TLSv1    Disallow the use of TLSv1.0
#			    NO_TLSv1_1  Disallow the use of TLSv1.1
#			    NO_TLSv1_2  Disallow the use of TLSv1.2
#
#			    SINGLE_DH_USE
#				      Always create a new key when using
#				      temporary/ephemeral DH key exchanges
#
#			    NO_TICKET
#				      Disable use of RFC5077 session tickets. Some servers
#				      may have problems understanding the TLS extension due
#				      to ambiguous specification in RFC4507.
#
#			    ALL       Enable various bug workarounds
#				      suggested as "harmless" by OpenSSL
#				      Be warned that this reduces SSL/TLS
#				      strength to some attacks.
#
#			See the OpenSSL SSL_CTX_set_options documentation for a
#			more complete list.
#	
#	sslcafile=... 	A file containing additional CA certificates to use
#			when verifying the peer certificate.
#	
#	sslcapath=...	A directory containing additional CA certificates to
#			use when verifying the peer certificate.
#	
#	sslcrlfile=... 	A certificate revocation list file to use when
#			verifying the peer certificate.
#	
#	sslflags=...	Specify various flags modifying the SSL implementation:
#	
#			DONT_VERIFY_PEER
#				Accept certificates even if they fail to
#				verify.
#			NO_DEFAULT_CA
#				Don't use the default CA list built in
#				to OpenSSL.
#			DONT_VERIFY_DOMAIN
#				Don't verify the peer certificate
#				matches the server name
#	
#	ssldomain= 	The peer name as advertised in it's certificate.
#			Used for verifying the correctness of the received peer
#			certificate. If not specified the peer hostname will be
#			used.
#	
#	front-end-https
#			Enable the "Front-End-Https: On" header needed when
#			using Squid as a SSL frontend in front of Microsoft OWA.
#			See MS KB document Q307347 for details on this header.
#			If set to auto the header will only be added if the
#			request is forwarded as a https:// URL.
#	
#	
#	==== GENERAL OPTIONS ====
#	
#	connect-timeout=N
#			A peer-specific connect timeout.
#			Also see the peer_connect_timeout directive.
#	
#	connect-fail-limit=N
#			How many times connecting to a peer must fail before
#			it is marked as down. Standby connection failures
#			count towards this limit. Default is 10.
#	
#	allow-miss	Disable Squid's use of only-if-cached when forwarding
#			requests to siblings. This is primarily useful when
#			icp_hit_stale is used by the sibling. Excessive use
#			of this option may result in forwarding loops. One way
#			to prevent peering loops when using this option, is to
#			deny cache peer usage on requests from a peer:
#			acl fromPeer ...
#			cache_peer_access peerName deny fromPeer
#	
#	max-conn=N 	Limit the number of concurrent connections the Squid
#			may open to this peer, including already opened idle
#			and standby connections. There is no peer-specific
#			connection limit by default.
#	
#			A peer exceeding the limit is not used for new
#			requests unless a standby connection is available.
#	
#			max-conn currently works poorly with idle persistent
#			connections: When a peer reaches its max-conn limit,
#			and there are idle persistent connections to the peer,
#			the peer may not be selected because the limiting code
#			does not know whether Squid can reuse those idle
#			connections.
#	
#	standby=N	Maintain a pool of N "hot standby" connections to an
#			UP peer, available for requests when no idle
#			persistent connection is available (or safe) to use.
#			By default and with zero N, no such pool is maintained.
#			N must not exceed the max-conn limit (if any).
#	
#			At start or after reconfiguration, Squid opens new TCP
#			standby connections until there are N connections
#			available and then replenishes the standby pool as
#			opened connections are used up for requests. A used
#			connection never goes back to the standby pool, but
#			may go to the regular idle persistent connection pool
#			shared by all peers and origin servers.
#	
#			Squid never opens multiple new standby connections
#			concurrently.  This one-at-a-time approach minimizes
#			flooding-like effect on peers. Furthermore, just a few
#			standby connections should be sufficient in most cases
#			to supply most new requests with a ready-to-use
#			connection.
#	
#			Standby connections obey server_idle_pconn_timeout.
#			For the feature to work as intended, the peer must be
#			configured to accept and keep them open longer than
#			the idle timeout at the connecting Squid, to minimize
#			race conditions typical to idle used persistent
#			connections. Default request_timeout and
#			server_idle_pconn_timeout values ensure such a
#			configuration.
#	
#	name=xxx	Unique name for the peer.
#			Required if you have multiple peers on the same host
#			but different ports.
#			This name can be used in cache_peer_access and similar
#			directives to identify the peer.
#			Can be used by outgoing access controls through the
#			peername ACL type.
#	
#	no-tproxy	Do not use the client-spoof TPROXY support when forwarding
#			requests to this peer. Use normal address selection instead.
#			This overrides the spoof_client_ip ACL.
#	
#	proxy-only	objects fetched from the peer will not be stored locally.
#	
#Default:
# none

#  TAG: cache_peer_domain
#	Use to limit the domains for which a neighbor cache will be
#	queried.
#
#	Usage:
#		cache_peer_domain cache-host domain [domain ...]
#		cache_peer_domain cache-host !domain
#
#	For example, specifying
#
#		cache_peer_domain parent.foo.net	.edu
#
#	has the effect such that UDP query packets are sent to
#	'bigserver' only when the requested object exists on a
#	server in the .edu domain.  Prefixing the domainname
#	with '!' means the cache will be queried for objects
#	NOT in that domain.
#
#	NOTE:	* Any number of domains may be given for a cache-host,
#		  either on the same or separate lines.
#		* When multiple domains are given for a particular
#		  cache-host, the first matched domain is applied.
#		* Cache hosts with no domain restrictions are queried
#		  for all requests.
#		* There are no defaults.
#		* There is also a 'cache_peer_access' tag in the ACL
#		  section.
#Default:
# none

#  TAG: cache_peer_access
#	Restricts usage of cache_peer proxies.
#
#	Usage:
#		cache_peer_access peer-name allow|deny [!]aclname ...
#
#	For the required peer-name parameter, use either the value of the
#	cache_peer name=value parameter or, if name=value is missing, the
#	cache_peer hostname parameter.
#
#	This directive narrows down the selection of peering candidates, but
#	does not determine the order in which the selected candidates are
#	contacted. That order is determined by the peer selection algorithms
#	(see PEER SELECTION sections in the cache_peer documentation).
#
#	If a deny rule matches, the corresponding peer will not be contacted
#	for the current transaction -- Squid will not send ICP queries and
#	will not forward HTTP requests to that peer. An allow match leaves
#	the corresponding peer in the selection. The first match for a given
#	peer wins for that peer.
#
#	The relative order of cache_peer_access directives for the same peer
#	matters. The relative order of any two cache_peer_access directives
#	for different peers does not matter. To ease interpretation, it is a
#	good idea to group cache_peer_access directives for the same peer
#	together.
#
#	A single cache_peer_access directive may be evaluated multiple times
#	for a given transaction because individual peer selection algorithms
#	may check it independently from each other. These redundant checks
#	may be optimized away in future Squid versions.
#
#	This clause only supports fast acl types.
#	See http://wiki.squid-cache.org/SquidFaq/SquidAcl for details.
#Default:
# No peer usage restrictions.

#  TAG: neighbor_type_domain
#	Modify the cache_peer neighbor type when passing requests
#	about specific domains to the peer.
#
#	Usage:
#		 neighbor_type_domain neighbor parent|sibling domain domain ...
#
#	For example:
#		cache_peer foo.example.com parent 3128 3130
#		neighbor_type_domain foo.example.com sibling .au .de
#
#	The above configuration treats all requests to foo.example.com as a
#	parent proxy unless the request is for a .au or .de ccTLD domain name.
#Default:
# The peer type from cache_peer directive is used for all requests to that peer.

#  TAG: dead_peer_timeout	(seconds)
#	This controls how long Squid waits to declare a peer cache
#	as "dead."  If there are no ICP replies received in this
#	amount of time, Squid will declare the peer dead and not
#	expect to receive any further ICP replies.  However, it
#	continues to send ICP queries, and will mark the peer as
#	alive upon receipt of the first subsequent ICP reply.
#
#	This timeout also affects when Squid expects to receive ICP
#	replies from peers.  If more than 'dead_peer' seconds have
#	passed since the last ICP reply was received, Squid will not
#	expect to receive an ICP reply on the next query.  Thus, if
#	your time between requests is greater than this timeout, you
#	will see a lot of requests sent DIRECT to origin servers
#	instead of to your parents.
#Default:
# dead_peer_timeout 10 seconds

#  TAG: forward_max_tries
#	Controls how many different forward paths Squid will try
#	before giving up. See also forward_timeout.
#	
#	NOTE: connect_retries (default: none) can make each of these
#	possible forwarding paths be tried multiple times.
#Default:
# forward_max_tries 25

# MEMORY CACHE OPTIONS
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

#  TAG: cache_mem	(bytes)
#	NOTE: THIS PARAMETER DOES NOT SPECIFY THE MAXIMUM PROCESS SIZE.
#	IT ONLY PLACES A LIMIT ON HOW MUCH ADDITIONAL MEMORY SQUID WILL
#	USE AS A MEMORY CACHE OF OBJECTS. SQUID USES MEMORY FOR OTHER
#	THINGS AS WELL. SEE THE SQUID FAQ SECTION 8 FOR DETAILS.
#
#	'cache_mem' specifies the ideal amount of memory to be used
#	for:
#		* In-Transit objects
#		* Hot Objects
#		* Negative-Cached objects
#
#	Data for these objects are stored in 4 KB blocks.  This
#	parameter specifies the ideal upper limit on the total size of
#	4 KB blocks allocated.  In-Transit objects take the highest
#	priority.
#
#	In-transit objects have priority over the others.  When
#	additional space is needed for incoming data, negative-cached
#	and hot objects will be released.  In other words, the
#	negative-cached and hot objects will fill up any unused space
#	not needed for in-transit objects.
#
#	If circumstances require, this limit will be exceeded.
#	Specifically, if your incoming request rate requires more than
#	'cache_mem' of memory to hold in-transit objects, Squid will
#	exceed this limit to satisfy the new requests.  When the load
#	decreases, blocks will be freed until the high-water mark is
#	reached.  Thereafter, blocks will be used to store hot
#	objects.
#
#	If shared memory caching is enabled, Squid does not use the shared
#	cache space for in-transit objects, but they still consume as much
#	local memory as they need. For more details about the shared memory
#	cache, see memory_cache_shared.
#Default:
# cache_mem 256 MB

#  TAG: maximum_object_size_in_memory	(bytes)
#	Objects greater than this size will not be attempted to kept in
#	the memory cache. This should be set high enough to keep objects
#	accessed frequently in memory to improve performance whilst low
#	enough to keep larger objects from hoarding cache_mem.
#Default:
# maximum_object_size_in_memory 512 KB

#  TAG: memory_cache_shared	on|off
#	Controls whether the memory cache is shared among SMP workers.
#
#	The shared memory cache is meant to occupy cache_mem bytes and replace
#	the non-shared memory cache, although some entities may still be
#	cached locally by workers for now (e.g., internal and in-transit
#	objects may be served from a local memory cache even if shared memory
#	caching is enabled).
#
#	By default, the memory cache is shared if and only if all of the
#	following conditions are satisfied: Squid runs in SMP mode with
#	multiple workers, cache_mem is positive, and Squid environment
#	supports required IPC primitives (e.g., POSIX shared memory segments
#	and GCC-style atomic operations).
#
#	To avoid blocking locks, shared memory uses opportunistic algorithms
#	that do not guarantee that every cachable entity that could have been
#	shared among SMP workers will actually be shared.
#Default:
# "on" where supported if doing memory caching with multiple SMP workers.

#  TAG: memory_cache_mode
#	Controls which objects to keep in the memory cache (cache_mem)
#
#	always	Keep most recently fetched objects in memory (default)
#
#	disk	Only disk cache hits are kept in memory, which means
#		an object must first be cached on disk and then hit
#		a second time before cached in memory.
#
#	network	Only objects fetched from network is kept in memory
#Default:
# Keep the most recently fetched objects in memory

#  TAG: memory_replacement_policy
#	The memory replacement policy parameter determines which
#	objects are purged from memory when memory space is needed.
#
#	See cache_replacement_policy for details on algorithms.
#Default:
# memory_replacement_policy lru

# DISK CACHE OPTIONS
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

#  TAG: cache_replacement_policy
#	The cache replacement policy parameter determines which
#	objects are evicted (replaced) when disk space is needed.
#
#	    lru       : Squid's original list based LRU policy
#	    heap GDSF : Greedy-Dual Size Frequency
#	    heap LFUDA: Least Frequently Used with Dynamic Aging
#	    heap LRU  : LRU policy implemented using a heap
#
#	Applies to any cache_dir lines listed below this directive.
#
#	The LRU policies keeps recently referenced objects.
#
#	The heap GDSF policy optimizes object hit rate by keeping smaller
#	popular objects in cache so it has a better chance of getting a
#	hit.  It achieves a lower byte hit rate than LFUDA though since
#	it evicts larger (possibly popular) objects.
#
#	The heap LFUDA policy keeps popular objects in cache regardless of
#	their size and thus optimizes byte hit rate at the expense of
#	hit rate since one large, popular object will prevent many
#	smaller, slightly less popular objects from being cached.
#
#	Both policies utilize a dynamic aging mechanism that prevents
#	cache pollution that can otherwise occur with frequency-based
#	replacement policies.
#
#	NOTE: if using the LFUDA replacement policy you should increase
#	the value of maximum_object_size above its default of 4 MB to
#	to maximize the potential byte hit rate improvement of LFUDA.
#
#	For more information about the GDSF and LFUDA cache replacement
#	policies see http://www.hpl.hp.com/techreports/1999/HPL-1999-69.html
#	and http://fog.hpl.external.hp.com/techreports/98/HPL-98-173.html.
#Default:
# cache_replacement_policy lru

#  TAG: minimum_object_size	(bytes)
#	Objects smaller than this size will NOT be saved on disk.  The
#	value is specified in bytes, and the default is 0 KB, which
#	means all responses can be stored.
#Default:
# no limit

#  TAG: maximum_object_size	(bytes)
#	Set the default value for max-size parameter on any cache_dir.
#	The value is specified in bytes, and the default is 4 MB.
#	
#	If you wish to get a high BYTES hit ratio, you should probably
#	increase this (one 32 MB object hit counts for 3200 10KB
#	hits).
#	
#	If you wish to increase hit ratio more than you want to
#	save bandwidth you should leave this low.
#	
#	NOTE: if using the LFUDA replacement policy you should increase
#	this value to maximize the byte hit rate improvement of LFUDA!
#	See cache_replacement_policy for a discussion of this policy.
#Default:
# maximum_object_size 4 MB

#  TAG: cache_dir
#	Format:
#		cache_dir Type Directory-Name Fs-specific-data [options]
#
#	You can specify multiple cache_dir lines to spread the
#	cache among different disk partitions.
#
#	Type specifies the kind of storage system to use. Only "ufs"
#	is built by default. To enable any of the other storage systems
#	see the --enable-storeio configure option.
#
#	'Directory' is a top-level directory where cache swap
#	files will be stored.  If you want to use an entire disk
#	for caching, this can be the mount-point directory.
#	The directory must exist and be writable by the Squid
#	process.  Squid will NOT create this directory for you.
#
#	In SMP configurations, cache_dir must not precede the workers option
#	and should use configuration macros or conditionals to give each
#	worker interested in disk caching a dedicated cache directory.
#
#
#	====  The ufs store type  ====
#
#	"ufs" is the old well-known Squid storage format that has always
#	been there.
#
#	Usage:
#		cache_dir ufs Directory-Name Mbytes L1 L2 [options]
#
#	'Mbytes' is the amount of disk space (MB) to use under this
#	directory.  The default is 100 MB.  Change this to suit your
#	configuration.  Do NOT put the size of your disk drive here.
#	Instead, if you want Squid to use the entire disk drive,
#	subtract 20% and use that value.
#
#	'L1' is the number of first-level subdirectories which
#	will be created under the 'Directory'.  The default is 16.
#
#	'L2' is the number of second-level subdirectories which
#	will be created under each first-level directory.  The default
#	is 256.
#
#
#	====  The aufs store type  ====
#
#	"aufs" uses the same storage format as "ufs", utilizing
#	POSIX-threads to avoid blocking the main Squid process on
#	disk-I/O. This was formerly known in Squid as async-io.
#
#	Usage:
#		cache_dir aufs Directory-Name Mbytes L1 L2 [options]
#
#	see argument descriptions under ufs above
#
#
#	====  The diskd store type  ====
#
#	"diskd" uses the same storage format as "ufs", utilizing a
#	separate process to avoid blocking the main Squid process on
#	disk-I/O.
#
#	Usage:
#		cache_dir diskd Directory-Name Mbytes L1 L2 [options] [Q1=n] [Q2=n]
#
#	see argument descriptions under ufs above
#
#	Q1 specifies the number of unacknowledged I/O requests when Squid
#	stops opening new files. If this many messages are in the queues,
#	Squid won't open new files. Default is 64
#
#	Q2 specifies the number of unacknowledged messages when Squid
#	starts blocking.  If this many messages are in the queues,
#	Squid blocks until it receives some replies. Default is 72
#
#	When Q1 < Q2 (the default), the cache directory is optimized
#	for lower response time at the expense of a decrease in hit
#	ratio.  If Q1 > Q2, the cache directory is optimized for
#	higher hit ratio at the expense of an increase in response
#	time.
#
#
#	====  The rock store type  ====
#
#	Usage:
#	    cache_dir rock Directory-Name Mbytes [options]
#
#	The Rock Store type is a database-style storage. All cached
#	entries are stored in a "database" file, using fixed-size slots.
#	A single entry occupies one or more slots.
#
#	If possible, Squid using Rock Store creates a dedicated kid
#	process called "disker" to avoid blocking Squid worker(s) on disk
#	I/O. One disker kid is created for each rock cache_dir.  Diskers
#	are created only when Squid, running in daemon mode, has support
#	for the IpcIo disk I/O module.
#
#	swap-timeout=msec: Squid will not start writing a miss to or
#	reading a hit from disk if it estimates that the swap operation
#	will take more than the specified number of milliseconds. By
#	default and when set to zero, disables the disk I/O time limit
#	enforcement. Ignored when using blocking I/O module because
#	blocking synchronous I/O does not allow Squid to estimate the
#	expected swap wait time.
#
#	max-swap-rate=swaps/sec: Artificially limits disk access using
#	the specified I/O rate limit. Swap out requests that
#	would cause the average I/O rate to exceed the limit are
#	delayed. Individual swap in requests (i.e., hits or reads) are
#	not delayed, but they do contribute to measured swap rate and
#	since they are placed in the same FIFO queue as swap out
#	requests, they may wait longer if max-swap-rate is smaller.
#	This is necessary on file systems that buffer "too
#	many" writes and then start blocking Squid and other processes
#	while committing those writes to disk.  Usually used together
#	with swap-timeout to avoid excessive delays and queue overflows
#	when disk demand exceeds available disk "bandwidth". By default
#	and when set to zero, disables the disk I/O rate limit
#	enforcement. Currently supported by IpcIo module only.
#
#	slot-size=bytes: The size of a database "record" used for
#	storing cached responses. A cached response occupies at least
#	one slot and all database I/O is done using individual slots so
#	increasing this parameter leads to more disk space waste while
#	decreasing it leads to more disk I/O overheads. Should be a
#	multiple of your operating system I/O page size. Defaults to
#	16KBytes. A housekeeping header is stored with each slot and
#	smaller slot-sizes will be rejected. The header is smaller than
#	100 bytes.
#
#
#	==== COMMON OPTIONS ====
#
#	no-store	no new objects should be stored to this cache_dir.
#
#	min-size=n	the minimum object size in bytes this cache_dir
#			will accept.  It's used to restrict a cache_dir
#			to only store large objects (e.g. AUFS) while
#			other stores are optimized for smaller objects
#			(e.g. Rock).
#			Defaults to 0.
#
#	max-size=n	the maximum object size in bytes this cache_dir
#			supports.
#			The value in maximum_object_size directive sets
#			the default unless more specific details are
#			available (ie a small store capacity).
#
#	Note: To make optimal use of the max-size limits you should order
#	the cache_dir lines with the smallest max-size value first.
#
#Default:
# No disk cache. Store cache ojects only in memory.
#

# Uncomment and adjust the following to add a disk cache directory.
#cache_dir ufs /var/spool/squid 100 16 256

#  TAG: store_dir_select_algorithm
#	How Squid selects which cache_dir to use when the response
#	object will fit into more than one.
#
#	Regardless of which algorithm is used the cache_dir min-size
#	and max-size parameters are obeyed. As such they can affect
#	the selection algorithm by limiting the set of considered
#	cache_dir.
#
#	Algorithms:
#
#		least-load
#
#	This algorithm is suited to caches with similar cache_dir
#	sizes and disk speeds.
#
#	The disk with the least I/O pending is selected.
#	When there are multiple disks with the same I/O load ranking
#	the cache_dir with most available capacity is selected.
#
#	When a mix of cache_dir sizes are configured the faster disks
#	have a naturally lower I/O loading and larger disks have more
#	capacity. So space used to store objects and data throughput
#	may be very unbalanced towards larger disks.
#
#
#		round-robin
#
#	This algorithm is suited to caches with unequal cache_dir
#	disk sizes.
#
#	Each cache_dir is selected in a rotation. The next suitable
#	cache_dir is used.
#
#	Available cache_dir capacity is only considered in relation
#	to whether the object will fit and meets the min-size and
#	max-size parameters.
#
#	Disk I/O loading is only considered to prevent overload on slow
#	disks. This algorithm does not spread objects by size, so any
#	I/O loading per-disk may appear very unbalanced and volatile.
#
#	If several cache_dirs use similar min-size, max-size, or other
#	limits to reject certain responses, then do not group such
#	cache_dir lines together, to avoid round-robin selection bias
#	towards the first cache_dir after the group. Instead, interleave
#	cache_dir lines from different groups. For example:
#
#		store_dir_select_algorithm round-robin
#		cache_dir rock /hdd1 ... min-size=100000
#		cache_dir rock /ssd1 ... max-size=99999
#		cache_dir rock /hdd2 ... min-size=100000
#		cache_dir rock /ssd2 ... max-size=99999
#		cache_dir rock /hdd3 ... min-size=100000
#		cache_dir rock /ssd3 ... max-size=99999
#Default:
# store_dir_select_algorithm least-load

#  TAG: max_open_disk_fds
#	To avoid having disk as the I/O bottleneck Squid can optionally
#	bypass the on-disk cache if more than this amount of disk file
#	descriptors are open.
#
#	A value of 0 indicates no limit.
#Default:
# no limit

#  TAG: cache_swap_low	(percent, 0-100)
#	The low-water mark for AUFS/UFS/diskd cache object eviction by
#	the cache_replacement_policy algorithm.
#
#	Removal begins when the swap (disk) usage of a cache_dir is
#	above this low-water mark and attempts to maintain utilization
#	near the low-water mark.
#
#	As swap utilization increases towards the high-water mark set
#	by cache_swap_high object eviction becomes more agressive.
#
#	The value difference in percentages between low- and high-water
#	marks represent an eviction rate of 300 objects per second and
#	the rate continues to scale in agressiveness by multiples of
#	this above the high-water mark.
#
#	Defaults are 90% and 95%. If you have a large cache, 5% could be
#	hundreds of MB. If this is the case you may wish to set these
#	numbers closer together.
#
#	See also cache_swap_high and cache_replacement_policy
#Default:
# cache_swap_low 90

#  TAG: cache_swap_high	(percent, 0-100)
#	The high-water mark for AUFS/UFS/diskd cache object eviction by
#	the cache_replacement_policy algorithm.
#
#	Removal begins when the swap (disk) usage of a cache_dir is
#	above the low-water mark set by cache_swap_low and attempts to

# LOGFILE OPTIONS
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

#  TAG: logformat
#	Usage:
#
#	logformat <name> <format specification>
#
#	Defines an access log format.
#
#	The <format specification> is a string with embedded % format codes
#
#	% format codes all follow the same basic structure where all but
#	the formatcode is optional. Output strings are automatically escaped
#	as required according to their context and the output format
#	modifiers are usually not needed, but can be specified if an explicit
#	output format is desired.
#
#		% ["|[|'|#] [-] [[0]width] [{argument}] formatcode
#
#		"	output in quoted string format
#		[	output in squid text log format as used by log_mime_hdrs
#		#	output in URL quoted format
#		'	output as-is
#
#		-	left aligned
#
#		width	minimum and/or maximum field width:
#			    [width_min][.width_max]
#			When minimum starts with 0, the field is zero-padded.
#			String values exceeding maximum width are truncated.
#
#		{arg}	argument such as header name etc
#
#	Format codes:
#
#		%	a literal % character
#		sn	Unique sequence number per log line entry
#		err_code    The ID of an error response served by Squid or
#				a similar internal error identifier.
#		err_detail  Additional err_code-dependent error information.
#		note	The annotation specified by the argument. Also
#			logs the adaptation meta headers set by the
#			adaptation_meta configuration parameter.
#			If no argument given all annotations logged.
#			The argument may include a separator to use with
#			annotation values:
#                            name[:separator]
#			By default, multiple note values are separated with ","
#			and multiple notes are separated with "\r\n".
#			When logging named notes with %{name}note, the
#			explicitly configured separator is used between note
#			values. When logging all notes with %note, the
#			explicitly configured separator is used between
#			individual notes. There is currently no way to
#			specify both value and notes separators when logging
#			all notes with %note.
#
#	Connection related format codes:
#
#		>a	Client source IP address
#		>A	Client FQDN
#		>p	Client source port
#		>eui	Client source EUI (MAC address, EUI-48 or EUI-64 identifier)
#		>la	Local IP address the client connected to
#		>lp	Local port number the client connected to
#		>qos    Client connection TOS/DSCP value set by Squid
#		>nfmark Client connection netfilter mark set by Squid
#
#		la	Local listening IP address the client connection was connected to.
#		lp	Local listening port number the client connection was connected to.
#
#		<a	Server IP address of the last server or peer connection
#		<A	Server FQDN or peer name
#		<p	Server port number of the last server or peer connection
#		<la	Local IP address of the last server or peer connection
#		<lp     Local port number of the last server or peer connection
#		<qos	Server connection TOS/DSCP value set by Squid
#		<nfmark Server connection netfilter mark set by Squid
#
#	Time related format codes:
#
#		ts	Seconds since epoch
#		tu	subsecond time (milliseconds)
#		tl	Local time. Optional strftime format argument
#				default %d/%b/%Y:%H:%M:%S %z
#		tg	GMT time. Optional strftime format argument
#				default %d/%b/%Y:%H:%M:%S %z
#		tr	Response time (milliseconds)
#		dt	Total time spent making DNS lookups (milliseconds)
#		tS	Approximate master transaction start time in 
#			<full seconds since epoch>.<fractional seconds> format.
#			Currently, Squid considers the master transaction
#			started when a complete HTTP request header initiating
#			the transaction is received from the client. This is
#			the same value that Squid uses to calculate transaction
#			response time when logging %tr to access.log. Currently,
#			Squid uses millisecond resolution for %tS values,
#			similar to the default access.log "current time" field
#			(%ts.%03tu).
#
#	Access Control related format codes:
#
#		et	Tag returned by external acl
#		ea	Log string returned by external acl
#		un	User name (any available)
#		ul	User name from authentication
#		ue	User name from external acl helper
#		ui	User name from ident
#		un	A user name. Expands to the first available name
#			from the following list of information sources:
#			- authenticated user name, like %ul
#			- user name supplied by an external ACL, like %ue
#			- SSL client name, like %us
#			- ident user name, like %ui
#		credentials Client credentials. The exact meaning depends on
#			the authentication scheme: For Basic authentication,
#			it is the password; for Digest, the realm sent by the
#			client; for NTLM and Negotiate, the client challenge
#			or client credentials prefixed with "YR " or "KK ".
#
#	HTTP related format codes:
#
#	    REQUEST

#				argument using name[:[separator]element] format.
#		[http::]>ha	Received request header after adaptation and
#				redirection (pre-cache REQMOD vectoring point).
#				Usually differs from the request header sent by
#				Squid, although most fields are often preserved.
#				Optional header name argument as for >h
#
#
#	    RESPONSE
#
#		[http::]<Hs	HTTP status code received from the next hop
#		[http::]>Hs	HTTP status code sent to the client
#
#		[http::]<h	Reply header. Optional header name argument
#				as for >h
#
#		[http::]mt	MIME content type
#
#
#	    SIZE COUNTERS
#
#		[http::]st	Total size of request + reply traffic with client
#		[http::]>st	Total size of request received from client.
#				Excluding chunked encoding bytes.
#		[http::]<st	Total size of reply sent to client (after adaptation)

#
#
#	    TIMING
#
#		[http::]<pt	Peer response time in milliseconds. The timer starts
#				when the last request byte is sent to the next hop
#				and stops when the last response byte is received.
#		[http::]<tt	Total time in milliseconds. The timer 
#				starts with the first connect request (or write I/O)
#				sent to the first selected peer. The timer stops
#				with the last I/O with the last peer.
#
#	Squid handling related format codes:
#
#		Ss	Squid request status (TCP_MISS etc)
#		Sh	Squid hierarchy status (DEFAULT_PARENT etc)
#
#	SSL-related format codes:
#
#		ssl::bump_mode	SslBump decision for the transaction:
#
#				For CONNECT requests that initiated bumping of
#				a connection and for any request received on
#				an already bumped connection, Squid logs the
#				corresponding SslBump mode ("server-first" or
#				"client-first"). See the ssl_bump option for
#				more information about these modes.
#
#				A "none" token is logged for requests that
#				triggered "ssl_bump" ACL evaluation matching
#				either a "none" rule or no rules at all.
#
#				In all other cases, a single dash ("-") is
#				logged.
#
#		ssl::>sni	SSL client SNI sent to Squid. Available only
#				after the peek, stare, or splice SSL bumping
#				actions.
#
#	If ICAP is enabled, the following code becomes available (as
#	well as ICAP log codes documented with the icap_log option):
#
#		icap::tt        Total ICAP processing time for the HTTP
#				transaction. The timer ticks when ICAP
#				ACLs are checked and when ICAP
#				transaction is in progress.
#
#	If adaptation is enabled the following three codes become available:
#
#		adapt::<last_h	The header of the last ICAP response or
#				meta-information from the last eCAP
#				transaction related to the HTTP transaction.
#				Like <h, accepts an optional header name
#				argument.
#
#		adapt::sum_trs Summed adaptation transaction response
#				times recorded as a comma-separated list in
#				the order of transaction start time. Each time
#				value is recorded as an integer number,
#				representing response time of one or more
#				adaptation (ICAP or eCAP) transaction in
#				milliseconds.  When a failed transaction is
#				being retried or repeated, its time is not
#				logged individually but added to the
#				replacement (next) transaction. See also:
#				adapt::all_trs.
#
#		adapt::all_trs All adaptation transaction response times.
#				Same as adaptation_strs but response times of
#				individual transactions are never added
#				together. Instead, all transaction response
#				times are recorded individually.
#
#	You can prefix adapt::*_trs format codes with adaptation
#	service name in curly braces to record response time(s) specific
#	to that service. For example: %{my_service}adapt::sum_trs
#
#	If SSL is enabled, the following formating codes become available:
#
#		%ssl::>cert_subject The Subject field of the received client
#				SSL certificate or a dash ('-') if Squid has
#				received an invalid/malformed certificate or
#				no certificate at all. Consider encoding the
#				logged value because Subject often has spaces.
#
#		%ssl::>cert_issuer The Issuer field of the received client
#				SSL certificate or a dash ('-') if Squid has
#				received an invalid/malformed certificate or
#				no certificate at all. Consider encoding the
#				logged value because Issuer often has spaces.
#
#	The default formats available (which do not need re-defining) are:
#
#logformat squid      %ts.%03tu %6tr %>a %Ss/%03>Hs %<st %rm %ru %[un %Sh/%<a %mt
#logformat common     %>a %[ui %[un [%tl] "%rm %ru HTTP/%rv" %>Hs %<st %Ss:%Sh
#logformat combined   %>a %[ui %[un [%tl] "%rm %ru HTTP/%rv" %>Hs %<st "%{Referer}>h" "%{User-Agent}>h" %Ss:%Sh
#logformat referrer   %ts.%03tu %>a %{Referer}>h %ru
#logformat useragent  %>a [%tl] "%{User-Agent}>h"
#
#	NOTE: When the log_mime_hdrs directive is set to ON.
#		The squid, common and combined formats have a safely encoded copy
#		of the mime headers appended to each line within a pair of brackets.
#
#	NOTE: The common and combined formats are not quite true to the Apache definition.
#		The logs from Squid contain an extra status and hierarchy code appended.
#
#Default:
# The format definitions squid, common, combined, referrer, useragent are built in.

#  TAG: access_log
#	Configures whether and how Squid logs HTTP and ICP transactions.
#	If access logging is enabled, a single line is logged for every 
#	matching HTTP or ICP request. The recommended directive formats are:
#
#	access_log <module>:<place> [option ...] [acl acl ...]
#	access_log none [acl acl ...]
#
#	The following directive format is accepted but may be deprecated:
#	access_log <module>:<place> [<logformat name> [acl acl ...]]
#
#        In most cases, the first ACL name must not contain the '=' character
#	and should not be equal to an existing logformat name. You can always
#	start with an 'all' ACL to work around those restrictions.
#	
#	Will log to the specified module:place using the specified format (which
#	must be defined in a logformat directive) those entries which match
#	ALL the acl's specified (which must be defined in acl clauses).
#	If no acl is specified, all requests will be logged to this destination.
#	
#	===== Available options for the recommended directive format =====
#
#	logformat=name		Names log line format (either built-in or
#				defined by a logformat directive). Defaults
#				to 'squid'.
#
#	buffer-size=64KB	Defines approximate buffering limit for log
#				records (see buffered_logs).  Squid should not
#				keep more than the specified size and, hence,
#				should flush records before the buffer becomes
#				full to avoid overflows under normal
#				conditions (the exact flushing algorithm is
#				module-dependent though).  The on-error option
#				controls overflow handling.
#
#	on-error=die|drop	Defines action on unrecoverable errors. The
#				'drop' action ignores (i.e., does not log)
#				affected log records. The default 'die' action
#				kills the affected worker. The drop action 
#				support has not been tested for modules other
#				than tcp.
#
#	===== Modules Currently available =====
#	
#	none	Do not log any requests matching these ACL.
#		Do not specify Place or logformat name.
#	
#	stdio	Write each log line to disk immediately at the completion of
#		each request.
#		Place: the filename and path to be written.
#	
#	daemon	Very similar to stdio. But instead of writing to disk the log
#		line is passed to a daemon helper for asychronous handling instead.
#		Place: varies depending on the daemon.
#		
#		log_file_daemon Place: the file name and path to be written.
#	
#	syslog	To log each request via syslog facility.
#		Place: The syslog facility and priority level for these entries.
#		Place Format:  facility.priority
#
#		where facility could be any of:
#			authpriv, daemon, local0 ... local7 or user.
#
#		And priority could be any of:
#			err, warning, notice, info, debug.
#	
#	udp	To send each log line as text data to a UDP receiver.
#		Place: The destination host name or IP and port.
#		Place Format:   //host:port
#
#	tcp	To send each log line as text data to a TCP receiver.
#		Lines may be accumulated before sending (see buffered_logs).
#		Place: The destination host name or IP and port.
#		Place Format:   //host:port
#
#	Default:
#		access_log daemon:/var/log/squid/access.log squid
#Default:
# access_log daemon:/var/log/squid/access.log squid

#  TAG: icap_log
#	ICAP log files record ICAP transaction summaries, one line per
#	transaction.
#
#	The icap_log option format is:
#	icap_log <filepath> [<logformat name> [acl acl ...]]
#	icap_log none [acl acl ...]]
#	
#	Please see access_log option documentation for details. The two
#	kinds of logs share the overall configuration approach and many
#	features.
#
#	ICAP processing of a single HTTP message or transaction may
#	require multiple ICAP transactions.  In such cases, multiple
#	ICAP transaction log lines will correspond to a single access
#	log line.
#
#	ICAP log supports many access.log logformat %codes. In ICAP context,
#	HTTP message-related %codes are applied to the HTTP message embedded
#	in an ICAP message. Logformat "%http::>..." codes are used for HTTP
#	messages embedded in ICAP requests while "%http::<..." codes are used
#	for HTTP messages embedded in ICAP responses. For example:
#
#		http::>h	To-be-adapted HTTP message headers sent by Squid to
#				the ICAP service. For REQMOD transactions, these are
#				HTTP request headers. For RESPMOD, these are HTTP
#				response headers, but Squid currently cannot log them
#				(i.e., %http::>h will expand to "-" for RESPMOD).
#
#		http::<h	Adapted HTTP message headers sent by the ICAP
#				service to Squid (i.e., HTTP request headers in regular
#				REQMOD; HTTP response headers in RESPMOD and during
#				request satisfaction in REQMOD).
#
#	ICAP OPTIONS transactions do not embed HTTP messages.
#
#	Several logformat codes below deal with ICAP message bodies. An ICAP
#	message body, if any, typically includes a complete HTTP message
#	(required HTTP headers plus optional HTTP message body). When
#	computing HTTP message body size for these logformat codes, Squid
#	either includes or excludes chunked encoding overheads; see
#	code-specific documentation for details.
#
#	For Secure ICAP services, all size-related information is currently
#	computed before/after TLS encryption/decryption, as if TLS was not
#	in use at all.
#
#	The following format codes are also available for ICAP logs:
#
#		icap::<A	ICAP server IP address. Similar to <A.
#
#		icap::<service_name	ICAP service name from the icap_service
#				option in Squid configuration file.
#
#		icap::ru	ICAP Request-URI. Similar to ru.
#
#		icap::rm	ICAP request method (REQMOD, RESPMOD, or 
#				OPTIONS). Similar to existing rm.
#
#		icap::>st	The total size of the ICAP request sent to the ICAP
#				server (ICAP headers + ICAP body), including chunking
#				metadata (if any).
#
#		icap::<st	The total size of the ICAP response received from the
#				ICAP server (ICAP headers + ICAP body), including
#				chunking metadata (if any).
#
#		icap::<bs	The size of the ICAP response body received from the
#				ICAP server, excluding chunking metadata (if any).
#
#		icap::tr 	Transaction response time (in
#				milliseconds).  The timer starts when
#				the ICAP transaction is created and
#				stops when the transaction is completed.
#				Similar to tr.
#
#		icap::tio	Transaction I/O time (in milliseconds). The
#				timer starts when the first ICAP request
#				byte is scheduled for sending. The timers
#				stops when the last byte of the ICAP response
#				is received.
#
#		icap::to 	Transaction outcome: ICAP_ERR* for all
#				transaction errors, ICAP_OPT for OPTION
#				transactions, ICAP_ECHO for 204
#				responses, ICAP_MOD for message
#				modification, and ICAP_SAT for request
#				satisfaction. Similar to Ss.
#
#		icap::Hs	ICAP response status code. Similar to Hs.
#
#		icap::>h	ICAP request header(s). Similar to >h.
#
#		icap::<h	ICAP response header(s). Similar to <h.
#
#	The default ICAP log format, which can be used without an explicit
#	definition, is called icap_squid:
#
#logformat icap_squid %ts.%03tu %6icap::tr %>A %icap::to/%03icap::Hs %icap::<st %icap::rm %icap::ru %un -/%icap::<A -
#
#	See also: logformat and %adapt::<last_h
#Default:
# none

#  TAG: logfile_daemon
#	Specify the path to the logfile-writing daemon. This daemon is
#	used to write the access and store logs, if configured.
#
#	Squid sends a number of commands to the log daemon:
#	  L<data>\n - logfile data
#	  R\n - rotate file
#	  T\n - truncate file
#	  O\n - reopen file
#	  F\n - flush file
#	  r<n>\n - set rotate count to <n>
#	  b<n>\n - 1 = buffer output, 0 = don't buffer output
#
#	No responses is expected.
#Default:
# logfile_daemon /usr/lib/squid/log_file_daemon

#  TAG: stats_collection	allow|deny acl acl...
#	This options allows you to control which requests gets accounted
#	in performance counters.
#
#	This clause only supports fast acl types.
#	See http://wiki.squid-cache.org/SquidFaq/SquidAcl for details.
#Default:
# Allow logging for all transactions.

#  TAG: cache_store_log
#	Logs the activities of the storage manager.  Shows which
#	objects are ejected from the cache, and which objects are
#	saved and for how long.
#	There are not really utilities to analyze this data, so you can safely
#	disable it (the default).
#	
#	Store log uses modular logging outputs. See access_log for the list
#	of modules supported.
#	
#	Example:
#		cache_store_log stdio:/var/log/squid/store.log
#		cache_store_log daemon:/var/log/squid/store.log
#Default:
# none

#  TAG: cache_swap_state
#	Location for the cache "swap.state" file. This index file holds
#	the metadata of objects saved on disk.  It is used to rebuild
#	the cache during startup.  Normally this file resides in each
#	'cache_dir' directory, but you may specify an alternate
#	pathname here.  Note you must give a full filename, not just
#	a directory. Since this is the index for the whole object
#	list you CANNOT periodically rotate it!
#
#	If %s can be used in the file name it will be replaced with a
#	a representation of the cache_dir name where each / is replaced
#	with '.'. This is needed to allow adding/removing cache_dir
#	lines when cache_swap_log is being used.
#
#	If have more than one 'cache_dir', and %s is not used in the name
#	these swap logs will have names such as:
#
#		cache_swap_log.00
#		cache_swap_log.01
#		cache_swap_log.02
#
#	The numbered extension (which is added automatically)
#	corresponds to the order of the 'cache_dir' lines in this
#	configuration file.  If you change the order of the 'cache_dir'
#	lines in this file, these index files will NOT correspond to
#	the correct 'cache_dir' entry (unless you manually rename
#	them).  We recommend you do NOT use this option.  It is
#	better to keep these index files in each 'cache_dir' directory.
#Default:
# Store the journal inside its cache_dir

#  TAG: logfile_rotate
#	Specifies the number of logfile rotations to make when you
#	type 'squid -k rotate'. The default is 10, which will rotate
#	with extensions 0 through 9. Setting logfile_rotate to 0 will
#	disable the file name rotation, but the logfiles are still closed
#	and re-opened. This will enable you to rename the logfiles
#	yourself just before sending the rotate signal.
#
#	Note, the 'squid -k rotate' command normally sends a USR1
#	signal to the running squid process.  In certain situations
#	(e.g. on Linux with Async I/O), USR1 is used for other
#	purposes, so -k rotate uses another signal.  It is best to get
#	in the habit of using 'squid -k rotate' instead of 'kill -USR1
#	<pid>'.
#
#	Note, from Squid-3.1 this option is only a default for cache.log,
#	that log can be rotated separately by using debug_options.
#
#	Note2, for Debian/Linux the default of logfile_rotate is
#	zero, since it includes external logfile-rotation methods.
#Default:
# logfile_rotate 0

#  TAG: mime_table
#	Path to Squid's icon configuration file.
#
#	You shouldn't need to change this, but the default file contains
#	examples and formatting information if you do.
#Default:
# mime_table /usr/share/squid/mime.conf

#  TAG: log_mime_hdrs	on|off
#	The Cache can record both the request and the response MIME
#	headers for each HTTP transaction.  The headers are encoded
#	safely and will appear as two bracketed fields at the end of
#	the access log (for either the native or httpd-emulated log
#	formats).  To enable this logging set log_mime_hdrs to 'on'.
#Default:
# log_mime_hdrs off

#  TAG: pid_filename
#	A filename to write the process-id to.  To disable, enter "none".
#Default:
# pid_filename /var/run/squid.pid

#  TAG: client_netmask
#	A netmask for client addresses in logfiles and cachemgr output.
#	Change this to protect the privacy of your cache clients.
#	A netmask of 255.255.255.0 will log all IP's in that range with
#	the last digit set to '0'.
#Default:
# Log full client IP address

#  TAG: strip_query_terms
#	By default, Squid strips query terms from requested URLs before
#	logging.  This protects your user's privacy and reduces log size.
#
#	When investigating HIT/MISS or other caching behaviour you
#	will need to disable this to see the full URL used by Squid.
#Default:
# strip_query_terms on

#  TAG: buffered_logs	on|off
#	Whether to write/send access_log records ASAP or accumulate them and
#	then write/send them in larger chunks. Buffering may improve
#	performance because it decreases the number of I/Os. However,
#	buffering increases the delay before log records become available to
#	the final recipient (e.g., a disk file or logging daemon) and,
#	hence, increases the risk of log records loss.
#
#	Note that even when buffered_logs are off, Squid may have to buffer
#	records if it cannot write/send them immediately due to pending I/Os
#	(e.g., the I/O writing the previous log record) or connectivity loss.
#
#	Currently honored by 'daemon' and 'tcp' access_log modules only.
#Default:
# buffered_logs off

#  TAG: netdb_filename
#	Where Squid stores it's netdb journal.
#	When enabled this journal preserves netdb state between restarts.
#
#	To disable, enter "none".
#Default:
# netdb_filename stdio:/var/log/squid/netdb.state

# OPTIONS FOR TROUBLESHOOTING
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

#  TAG: cache_log
#	Squid administrative logging file.
#
#	This is where general information about Squid behavior goes. You can
#	increase the amount of data logged to this file and how often it is
#	rotated with "debug_options"
#Default:
# cache_log /var/log/squid/cache.log

#  TAG: debug_options
#	Logging options are set as section,level where each source file
#	is assigned a unique section.  Lower levels result in less
#	output,  Full debugging (level 9) can result in a very large
#	log file, so be careful.
#
#	The magic word "ALL" sets debugging levels for all sections.
#	The default is to run with "ALL,1" to record important warnings.
#
#	The rotate=N option can be used to keep more or less of these logs
#	than would otherwise be kept by logfile_rotate.
#	For most uses a single log should be enough to monitor current
#	events affecting Squid.
#Default:
# Log all critical and important messages.

#  TAG: coredump_dir
#	By default Squid leaves core files in the directory from where
#	it was started. If you set 'coredump_dir' to a directory
#	that exists, Squid will chdir() to that directory at startup
#	and coredump files will be left there.
#
#Default:
# Use the directory from where Squid was started.
#

# Leave coredumps in the first cache dir
coredump_dir /var/spool/squid

# OPTIONS FOR FTP GATEWAYING
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

#  TAG: ftp_user
#	If you want the anonymous login password to be more informative
#	(and enable the use of picky FTP servers), set this to something
#	reasonable for your domain, like wwwuser@somewhere.net
#
#	The reason why this is domainless by default is the
#	request can be made on the behalf of a user in any domain,
#	depending on how the cache is used.
#	Some FTP server also validate the email address is valid
#	(for example perl.com).
#Default:
# ftp_user Squid@

#  TAG: ftp_passive
#	If your firewall does not allow Squid to use passive
#	connections, turn off this option.
#
#	Use of ftp_epsv_all option requires this to be ON.
#Default:
# ftp_passive on

#  TAG: ftp_epsv_all
#	FTP Protocol extensions permit the use of a special "EPSV ALL" command.
#
#	NATs may be able to put the connection on a "fast path" through the
#	translator, as the EPRT command will never be used and therefore,
#	translation of the data portion of the segments will never be needed.
#
#	When a client only expects to do two-way FTP transfers this may be
#	useful.
#	If squid finds that it must do a three-way FTP transfer after issuing
#	an EPSV ALL command, the FTP session will fail.
#
#	If you have any doubts about this option do not use it.
#	Squid will nicely attempt all other connection methods.
#
#	Requires ftp_passive to be ON (default) for any effect.
#Default:
# ftp_epsv_all off

#  TAG: ftp_epsv
#	FTP Protocol extensions permit the use of a special "EPSV" command.
#
#	NATs may be able to put the connection on a "fast path" through the
#	translator using EPSV, as the EPRT command will never be used
#	and therefore, translation of the data portion of the segments 
#	will never be needed.
#
#	EPSV is often required to interoperate with FTP servers on IPv6
#	networks. On the other hand, it may break some IPv4 servers.
#
#	By default, EPSV may try EPSV with any FTP server. To fine tune
#	that decision, you may restrict EPSV to certain clients or servers
#	using ACLs:
#
#		ftp_epsv allow|deny al1 acl2 ...
#
#	WARNING: Disabling EPSV may cause problems with external NAT and IPv6.
#
#	Only fast ACLs are supported.
#	Requires ftp_passive to be ON (default) for any effect.
#Default:
# none

#  TAG: ftp_eprt
#	FTP Protocol extensions permit the use of a special "EPRT" command.
#
#	This extension provides a protocol neutral alternative to the
#	IPv4-only PORT command. When supported it enables active FTP data
#	channels over IPv6 and efficient NAT handling.
#
#	Turning this OFF will prevent EPRT being attempted and will skip
#	straight to using PORT for IPv4 servers.
#
#	Some devices are known to not handle this extension correctly and
#	may result in crashes. Devices which suport EPRT enough to fail
#	cleanly will result in Squid attempting PORT anyway. This directive
#	should only be disabled when EPRT results in device failures.
#
#	WARNING: Doing so will convert Squid back to the old behavior with all
#	the related problems with external NAT devices/layers and IPv4-only FTP.
#Default:
# ftp_eprt on

#  TAG: ftp_sanitycheck
#	For security and data integrity reasons Squid by default performs
#	sanity checks of the addresses of FTP data connections ensure the
#	data connection is to the requested server. If you need to allow
#	FTP connections to servers using another IP address for the data
#	connection turn this off.
#Default:
# ftp_sanitycheck on

#  TAG: ftp_telnet_protocol
#	The FTP protocol is officially defined to use the telnet protocol
#	as transport channel for the control connection. However, many
#	implementations are broken and does not respect this aspect of
#	the FTP protocol.
#
#	If you have trouble accessing files with ASCII code 255 in the
#	path or similar problems involving this ASCII code you can
#	try setting this directive to off. If that helps, report to the
#	operator of the FTP server in question that their FTP server
#	is broken and does not follow the FTP standard.
#Default:
# ftp_telnet_protocol on

# OPTIONS FOR EXTERNAL SUPPORT PROGRAMS
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

#  TAG: diskd_program
#	Specify the location of the diskd executable.
#	Note this is only useful if you have compiled in
#	diskd as one of the store io modules.
#Default:
# diskd_program /usr/lib/squid/diskd

#  TAG: unlinkd_program
#	Specify the location of the executable for file deletion process.
#Default:
# unlinkd_program /usr/lib/squid/unlinkd

#  TAG: pinger_program
#	Specify the location of the executable for the pinger process.
#Default:
# pinger_program /usr/lib/squid/pinger

#  TAG: pinger_enable
#	Control whether the pinger is active at run-time.
#	Enables turning ICMP pinger on and off with a simple
#	squid -k reconfigure.
#Default:
# pinger_enable on

# OPTIONS FOR URL REWRITING
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

#  TAG: url_rewrite_program
#	Specify the location of the executable URL rewriter to use.
#	Since they can perform almost any function there isn't one included.
#
#	For each requested URL, the rewriter will receive on line with the format
#
#	  [channel-ID <SP>] URL [<SP> extras]<NL>
#
#	See url_rewrite_extras on how to send "extras" with optional values to
#	the helper.
#	After processing the request the helper must reply using the following format:
#
#	  [channel-ID <SP>] result [<SP> kv-pairs]
#
#	The result code can be:
#
#	  OK status=30N url="..."
#		Redirect the URL to the one supplied in 'url='.
#		'status=' is optional and contains the status code to send
#		the client in Squids HTTP response. It must be one of the
#		HTTP redirect status codes: 301, 302, 303, 307, 308.
#		When no status is given Squid will use 302.
#
#	  OK rewrite-url="..."
#		Rewrite the URL to the one supplied in 'rewrite-url='.
#		The new URL is fetched directly by Squid and returned to
#		the client as the response to its request.
#
#	  OK
#		When neither of url= and rewrite-url= are sent Squid does
#		not change the URL.
#
#	  ERR
#		Do not change the URL.
#
#	  BH
#		An internal error occurred in the helper, preventing
#		a result being identified. The 'message=' key name is
#		reserved for delivering a log message.
#
#
#	In addition to the above kv-pairs Squid also understands the following
#	optional kv-pairs received from URL rewriters:
#	  clt_conn_tag=TAG
#		Associates a TAG with the client TCP connection.
#		The TAG is treated as a regular annotation but persists across
#		future requests on the client connection rather than just the
#		current request. A helper may update the TAG during subsequent
#		requests be returning a new kv-pair.
#
#	When using the concurrency= option the protocol is changed by
#	introducing a query channel tag in front of the request/response.
#	The query channel tag is a number between 0 and concurrency-1.
#	This value must be echoed back unchanged to Squid as the first part
#	of the response relating to its request.
#
#	WARNING: URL re-writing ability should be avoided whenever possible.
#		 Use the URL redirect form of response instead.
#
#	Re-write creates a difference in the state held by the client
#	and server. Possibly causing confusion when the server response
#	contains snippets of its view state. Embeded URLs, response
#	and content Location headers, etc. are not re-written by this
#	interface.
#
#	By default, a URL rewriter is not used.
#Default:
# none

#  TAG: url_rewrite_children
#	The maximum number of redirector processes to spawn. If you limit
#	it too few Squid will have to wait for them to process a backlog of
#	URLs, slowing it down. If you allow too many they will use RAM
#	and other system resources noticably.
#	
#	The startup= and idle= options allow some measure of skew in your
#	tuning.
#	
#		startup=
#	
#	Sets a minimum of how many processes are to be spawned when Squid
#	starts or reconfigures. When set to zero the first request will
#	cause spawning of the first child process to handle it.
#	
#	Starting too few will cause an initial slowdown in traffic as Squid
#	attempts to simultaneously spawn enough processes to cope.
#	
#		idle=
#	
#	Sets a minimum of how many processes Squid is to try and keep available
#	at all times. When traffic begins to rise above what the existing
#	processes can handle this many more will be spawned up to the maximum
#	configured. A minimum setting of 1 is required.
#
#		concurrency=
#
#	The number of requests each redirector helper can handle in
#	parallel. Defaults to 0 which indicates the redirector
#	is a old-style single threaded redirector.
#
#	When this directive is set to a value >= 1 then the protocol
#	used to communicate with the helper is modified to include
#	an ID in front of the request/response. The ID from the request
#	must be echoed back with the response to that request.
#Default:
# url_rewrite_children 20 startup=0 idle=1 concurrency=0

#  TAG: url_rewrite_host_header
#	To preserve same-origin security policies in browsers and
#	prevent Host: header forgery by redirectors Squid rewrites
#	any Host: header in redirected requests.
#	
#	If you are running an accelerator this may not be a wanted
#	effect of a redirector. This directive enables you disable
#	Host: alteration in reverse-proxy traffic.
#	
#	WARNING: Entries are cached on the result of the URL rewriting
#	process, so be careful if you have domain-virtual hosts.
#	
#	WARNING: Squid and other software verifies the URL and Host
#	are matching, so be careful not to relay through other proxies
#	or inspecting firewalls with this disabled.
#Default:
# url_rewrite_host_header on

#  TAG: url_rewrite_access
#	If defined, this access list specifies which requests are
#	sent to the redirector processes.
#
#	This clause supports both fast and slow acl types.
#	See http://wiki.squid-cache.org/SquidFaq/SquidAcl for details.
#Default:
# Allow, unless rules exist in squid.conf.

#  TAG: url_rewrite_bypass
#	When this is 'on', a request will not go through the
#	redirector if all the helpers are busy.  If this is 'off'
#	and the redirector queue grows too large, Squid will exit
#	with a FATAL error and ask you to increase the number of
#	redirectors.  You should only enable this if the redirectors
#	are not critical to your caching system.  If you use
#	redirectors for access control, and you enable this option,
#	users may have access to pages they should not
#	be allowed to request.
#Default:
# url_rewrite_bypass off

#  TAG: url_rewrite_extras
#	Specifies a string to be append to request line format for the
#	rewriter helper. "Quoted" format values may contain spaces and
#	logformat %macros. In theory, any logformat %macro can be used.
#	In practice, a %macro expands as a dash (-) if the helper request is
#	sent before the required macro information is available to Squid.
#Default:
# url_rewrite_extras "%>a/%>A %un %>rm myip=%la myport=%lp"

# OPTIONS FOR STORE ID
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

#  TAG: store_id_program
#	Specify the location of the executable StoreID helper to use.
#	Since they can perform almost any function there isn't one included.
#
#	For each requested URL, the helper will receive one line with the format
#
#	  [channel-ID <SP>] URL [<SP> extras]<NL>
#
#
#	After processing the request the helper must reply using the following format:
#
#	  [channel-ID <SP>] result [<SP> kv-pairs]
#
#	The result code can be:
#
#	  OK store-id="..."
#		Use the StoreID supplied in 'store-id='.
#
#	  ERR
#		The default is to use HTTP request URL as the store ID.
#
#	  BH
#		An internal error occurred in the helper, preventing
#		a result being identified.
#
#	In addition to the above kv-pairs Squid also understands the following
#	optional kv-pairs received from URL rewriters:
#	  clt_conn_tag=TAG
#		Associates a TAG with the client TCP connection.
#		Please see url_rewrite_program related documentation for this
#		kv-pair
#
#	Helper programs should be prepared to receive and possibly ignore
#	additional whitespace-separated tokens on each input line.
#
#	When using the concurrency= option the protocol is changed by
#	introducing a query channel tag in front of the request/response.
#	The query channel tag is a number between 0 and concurrency-1.
#	This value must be echoed back unchanged to Squid as the first part
#	of the response relating to its request.
#
#	NOTE: when using StoreID refresh_pattern will apply to the StoreID
#	      returned from the helper and not the URL.
#
#	WARNING: Wrong StoreID value returned by a careless helper may result
#	         in the wrong cached response returned to the user.
#
#	By default, a StoreID helper is not used.
#Default:
# none

#  TAG: store_id_extras
#        Specifies a string to be append to request line format for the
#        StoreId helper. "Quoted" format values may contain spaces and
#        logformat %macros. In theory, any logformat %macro can be used.
#        In practice, a %macro expands as a dash (-) if the helper request is
#        sent before the required macro information is available to Squid.
#Default:
# store_id_extras "%>a/%>A %un %>rm myip=%la myport=%lp"

#  TAG: store_id_children
#	The maximum number of StoreID helper processes to spawn. If you limit
#	it too few Squid will have to wait for them to process a backlog of
#	requests, slowing it down. If you allow too many they will use RAM
#	and other system resources noticably.
#	
#	The startup= and idle= options allow some measure of skew in your

#
#		concurrency=
#
#	The number of requests each storeID helper can handle in

#
#	When this directive is set to a value >= 1 then the protocol

#	must be echoed back with the response to that request.
#Default:
# store_id_children 20 startup=0 idle=1 concurrency=0

#  TAG: store_id_access
#	If defined, this access list specifies which requests are
#	sent to the StoreID processes.  By default all requests
#	are sent.
#
#	This clause supports both fast and slow acl types.
#	See http://wiki.squid-cache.org/SquidFaq/SquidAcl for details.
#Default:
# Allow, unless rules exist in squid.conf.

#  TAG: store_id_bypass
#	When this is 'on', a request will not go through the
#	helper if all helpers are busy.  If this is 'off'
#	and the helper queue grows too large, Squid will exit
#	with a FATAL error and ask you to increase the number of
#	helpers.  You should only enable this if the helperss
#	are not critical to your caching system.  If you use
#	helpers for critical caching components, and you enable this 
#	option,	users may not get objects from cache.
#Default:
# store_id_bypass on

# OPTIONS FOR TUNING THE CACHE
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

#  TAG: cache
#	Requests denied by this directive will not be served from the cache
#	and their responses will not be stored in the cache. This directive
#	has no effect on other transactions and on already cached responses.
#
#	This clause supports both fast and slow acl types.
#	See http://wiki.squid-cache.org/SquidFaq/SquidAcl for details.
#
#	This and the two other similar caching directives listed below are
#	checked at different transaction processing stages, have different
#	access to response information, affect different cache operations,
#	and differ in slow ACLs support:
#
#	* cache: Checked before Squid makes a hit/miss determination.
#		No access to reply information!
#		Denies both serving a hit and storing a miss.
#		Supports both fast and slow ACLs.
#	* send_hit: Checked after a hit was detected.
#		Has access to reply (hit) information.
#		Denies serving a hit only.
#		Supports fast ACLs only.
#	* store_miss: Checked before storing a cachable miss.
#		Has access to reply (miss) information.
#		Denies storing a miss only.
#		Supports fast ACLs only.
#
#	If you are not sure which of the three directives to use, apply the
#	following decision logic:
#
#	* If your ACL(s) are of slow type _and_ need response info, redesign.
#	  Squid does not support that particular combination at this time.
#        Otherwise:
#	* If your directive ACL(s) are of slow type, use "cache"; and/or
#	* if your directive ACL(s) need no response info, use "cache".
#        Otherwise:
#	* If you do not want the response cached, use store_miss; and/or
#	* if you do not want a hit on a cached response, use send_hit.
#Default:
# By default, this directive is unused and has no effect.

#  TAG: send_hit
#	Responses denied by this directive will not be served from the cache
#	(but may still be cached, see store_miss). This directive has no
#	effect on the responses it allows and on the cached objects.
#
#	Please see the "cache" directive for a summary of differences among
#	store_miss, send_hit, and cache directives.
#
#	Unlike the "cache" directive, send_hit only supports fast acl
#	types.  See http://wiki.squid-cache.org/SquidFaq/SquidAcl for details.
#
#	For example:
#
#		# apply custom Store ID mapping to some URLs
#		acl MapMe dstdomain .c.example.com
#		store_id_program ...
#		store_id_access allow MapMe
#
#		# but prevent caching of special responses
#		# such as 302 redirects that cause StoreID loops
#		acl Ordinary http_status 200-299
#		store_miss deny MapMe !Ordinary
#
#		# and do not serve any previously stored special responses
#		# from the cache (in case they were already cached before
#		# the above store_miss rule was in effect).
#		send_hit deny MapMe !Ordinary
#Default:
# By default, this directive is unused and has no effect.

#  TAG: store_miss
#	Responses denied by this directive will not be cached (but may still
#	be served from the cache, see send_hit). This directive has no
#	effect on the responses it allows and on the already cached responses.
#
#	Please see the "cache" directive for a summary of differences among
#	store_miss, send_hit, and cache directives. See the
#	send_hit directive for a usage example.
#
#	Unlike the "cache" directive, store_miss only supports fast acl
#	types.  See http://wiki.squid-cache.org/SquidFaq/SquidAcl for details.
#Default:
# By default, this directive is unused and has no effect.

#  TAG: max_stale	time-units
#	This option puts an upper limit on how stale content Squid
#	will serve from the cache if cache validation fails.
#	Can be overriden by the refresh_pattern max-stale option.
#Default:
# max_stale 1 week

#  TAG: refresh_pattern
#	usage: refresh_pattern [-i] regex min percent max [options]
#
#	By default, regular expressions are CASE-SENSITIVE.  To make
#	them case-insensitive, use the -i option.
#
#	'Min' is the time (in minutes) an object without an explicit
#	expiry time should be considered fresh. The recommended
#	value is 0, any higher values may cause dynamic applications
#	to be erroneously cached unless the application designer
#	has taken the appropriate actions.
#
#	'Percent' is a percentage of the objects age (time since last
#	modification age) an object without explicit expiry time
#	will be considered fresh.
#
#	'Max' is an upper limit on how long objects without an explicit
#	expiry time will be considered fresh. The value is also used
#	to form Cache-Control: max-age header for a request sent from
#	Squid to origin/parent.
#
#	options: override-expire
#		 override-lastmod
#		 reload-into-ims
#		 ignore-reload
#		 ignore-no-store
#		 ignore-must-revalidate
#		 ignore-private
#		 ignore-auth
#		 max-stale=NN
#		 refresh-ims
#		 store-stale
#
#		override-expire enforces min age even if the server
#		sent an explicit expiry time (e.g., with the
#		Expires: header or Cache-Control: max-age). Doing this
#		VIOLATES the HTTP standard.  Enabling this feature
#		could make you liable for problems which it causes.
#
#		Note: override-expire does not enforce staleness - it only extends
#		freshness / min. If the server returns a Expires time which
#		is longer than your max time, Squid will still consider
#		the object fresh for that period of time.
#
#		override-lastmod enforces min age even on objects
#		that were modified recently.
#
#		reload-into-ims changes a client no-cache or ``reload''
#		request for a cached entry into a conditional request using
#		If-Modified-Since and/or If-None-Match headers, provided the
#		cached entry has a Last-Modified and/or a strong ETag header.
#		Doing this VIOLATES the HTTP standard. Enabling this feature
#		could make you liable for problems which it causes.
#
#		ignore-reload ignores a client no-cache or ``reload''
#		header. Doing this VIOLATES the HTTP standard. Enabling
#		this feature could make you liable for problems which
#		it causes.
#
#		ignore-no-store ignores any ``Cache-control: no-store''
#		headers received from a server. Doing this VIOLATES
#		the HTTP standard. Enabling this feature could make you
#		liable for problems which it causes.
#
#		ignore-must-revalidate ignores any ``Cache-Control: must-revalidate``
#		headers received from a server. Doing this VIOLATES
#		the HTTP standard. Enabling this feature could make you
#		liable for problems which it causes.
#
#		ignore-private ignores any ``Cache-control: private''
#		headers received from a server. Doing this VIOLATES
#		the HTTP standard. Enabling this feature could make you
#		liable for problems which it causes.
#
#		ignore-auth caches responses to requests with authorization,
#		as if the originserver had sent ``Cache-control: public''
#		in the response header. Doing this VIOLATES the HTTP standard.
#		Enabling this feature could make you liable for problems which
#		it causes.
#
#		refresh-ims causes squid to contact the origin server
#		when a client issues an If-Modified-Since request. This
#		ensures that the client will receive an updated version
#		if one is available.
#
#		store-stale stores responses even if they don't have explicit 
#		freshness or a validator (i.e., Last-Modified or an ETag) 
#		present, or if they're already stale. By default, Squid will 
#		not cache such responses because they usually can't be
#		reused. Note that such responses will be stale by default.
#
#		max-stale=NN provide a maximum staleness factor. Squid won't
#		serve objects more stale than this even if it failed to
#		validate the object. Default: use the max_stale global limit.
#
#	Basically a cached object is:
#
#		FRESH if expire > now, else STALE
#		STALE if age > max
#		FRESH if lm-factor < percent, else STALE
#		FRESH if age < min
#		else STALE
#
#	The refresh_pattern lines are checked in the order listed here.
#	The first entry which matches is used.  If none of the entries
#	match the default will be used.
#
#	Note, you must uncomment all the default lines if you want
#	to change one. The default setting is only active if none is
#	used.

#  TAG: quick_abort_min	(KB)
#Default:
# quick_abort_min 16 KB

#  TAG: quick_abort_max	(KB)
#Default:
# quick_abort_max 16 KB

#  TAG: quick_abort_pct	(percent)
#	The cache by default continues downloading aborted requests
#	which are almost completed (less than 16 KB remaining). This
#	may be undesirable on slow (e.g. SLIP) links and/or very busy
#	caches.  Impatient users may tie up file descriptors and
#	bandwidth by repeatedly requesting and immediately aborting
#	downloads.
#
#	When the user aborts a request, Squid will check the
#	quick_abort values to the amount of data transferred until
#	then.
#
#	If the transfer has less than 'quick_abort_min' KB remaining,
#	it will finish the retrieval.
#
#	If the transfer has more than 'quick_abort_max' KB remaining,
#	it will abort the retrieval.
#
#	If more than 'quick_abort_pct' of the transfer has completed,
#	it will finish the retrieval.
#
#	If you do not want any retrieval to continue after the client
#	has aborted, set both 'quick_abort_min' and 'quick_abort_max'
#	to '0 KB'.
#
#	If you want retrievals to always continue if they are being
#	cached set 'quick_abort_min' to '-1 KB'.
#Default:
# quick_abort_pct 95

#  TAG: read_ahead_gap	buffer-size
#	The amount of data the cache will buffer ahead of what has been
#	sent to the client when retrieving an object from another server.
#Default:
# read_ahead_gap 16 KB

#  TAG: negative_ttl	time-units
#	Set the Default Time-to-Live (TTL) for failed requests.
#	Certain types of failures (such as "connection refused" and
#	"404 Not Found") are able to be negatively-cached for a short time.
#	Modern web servers should provide Expires: header, however if they
#	do not this can provide a minimum TTL.
#	The default is not to cache errors with unknown expiry details.
#
#	Note that this is different from negative caching of DNS lookups.
#
#	WARNING: Doing this VIOLATES the HTTP standard.  Enabling
#	this feature could make you liable for problems which it
#	causes.
#Default:
# negative_ttl 0 seconds

#  TAG: positive_dns_ttl	time-units
#	Upper limit on how long Squid will cache positive DNS responses.
#	Default is 6 hours (360 minutes). This directive must be set
#	larger than negative_dns_ttl.
#Default:
# positive_dns_ttl 6 hours

#  TAG: negative_dns_ttl	time-units
#	Time-to-Live (TTL) for negative caching of failed DNS lookups.
#	This also sets the lower cache limit on positive lookups.
#	Minimum value is 1 second, and it is not recommendable to go
#	much below 10 seconds.
#Default:
# negative_dns_ttl 1 minutes

#  TAG: range_offset_limit	size [acl acl...]
#	usage: (size) [units] [[!]aclname]
#	
#	Sets an upper limit on how far (number of bytes) into the file 
#	a Range request	may be to cause Squid to prefetch the whole file. 
#	If beyond this limit, Squid forwards the Range request as it is and 
#	the result is NOT cached.
#	
#	This is to stop a far ahead range request (lets say start at 17MB)
#	from making Squid fetch the whole object up to that point before
#	sending anything to the client.
#	
#	Multiple range_offset_limit lines may be specified, and they will 
#	be searched from top to bottom on each request until a match is found. 
#	The first match found will be used.  If no line matches a request, the 
#	default limit of 0 bytes will be used.
#	
#	'size' is the limit specified as a number of units.
#	
#	'units' specifies whether to use bytes, KB, MB, etc.
#	If no units are specified bytes are assumed.
#	
#	A size of 0 causes Squid to never fetch more than the
#	client requested. (default)
#	
#	A size of 'none' causes Squid to always fetch the object from the
#	beginning so it may cache the result. (2.0 style)
#	
#	'aclname' is the name of a defined ACL.
#	
#	NP: Using 'none' as the byte value here will override any quick_abort settings 
#	    that may otherwise apply to the range request. The range request will
#	    be fully fetched from start to finish regardless of the client
#	    actions. This affects bandwidth usage.
#Default:
# none

#  TAG: minimum_expiry_time	(seconds)
#	The minimum caching time according to (Expires - Date)
#	headers Squid honors if the object can't be revalidated.
#	The default is 60 seconds.
#
#	In reverse proxy environments it might be desirable to honor
#	shorter object lifetimes. It is most likely better to make
#	your server return a meaningful Last-Modified header however.
#
#	In ESI environments where page fragments often have short
#	lifetimes, this will often be best set to 0.
#Default:
# minimum_expiry_time 60 seconds

#  TAG: store_avg_object_size	(bytes)
#	Average object size, used to estimate number of objects your
#	cache can hold.  The default is 13 KB.
#
#	This is used to pre-seed the cache index memory allocation to
#	reduce expensive reallocate operations while handling clients
#	traffic. Too-large values may result in memory allocation during
#	peak traffic, too-small values will result in wasted memory.
#
#	Check the cache manager 'info' report metrics for the real
#	object sizes seen by your Squid before tuning this.
#Default:
# store_avg_object_size 13 KB

#  TAG: store_objects_per_bucket
#	Target number of objects per bucket in the store hash table.
#	Lowering this value increases the total number of buckets and
#	also the storage maintenance rate.  The default is 20.
#Default:
# store_objects_per_bucket 20

# HTTP OPTIONS
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

#  TAG: request_header_max_size	(KB)
#	This specifies the maximum size for HTTP headers in a request.
#	Request headers are usually relatively small (about 512 bytes).
#	Placing a limit on the request header size will catch certain
#	bugs (for example with persistent connections) and possibly
#	buffer-overflow or denial-of-service attacks.
#Default:
# request_header_max_size 64 KB

#  TAG: reply_header_max_size	(KB)
#	This specifies the maximum size for HTTP headers in a reply.
#	Reply headers are usually relatively small (about 512 bytes).
#	Placing a limit on the reply header size will catch certain
#	bugs (for example with persistent connections) and possibly
#	buffer-overflow or denial-of-service attacks.
#Default:
# reply_header_max_size 64 KB

#  TAG: request_body_max_size	(bytes)
#	This specifies the maximum size for an HTTP request body.
#	In other words, the maximum size of a PUT/POST request.
#	A user who attempts to send a request with a body larger
#	than this limit receives an "Invalid Request" error message.
#	If you set this parameter to a zero (the default), there will
#	be no limit imposed.
#
#	See also client_request_buffer_max_size for an alternative
#	limitation on client uploads which can be configured.
#Default:
# No limit.

#  TAG: client_request_buffer_max_size	(bytes)
#	This specifies the maximum buffer size of a client request.
#	It prevents squid eating too much memory when somebody uploads
#	a large file.
#Default:
# client_request_buffer_max_size 512 KB

#  TAG: broken_posts
#	A list of ACL elements which, if matched, causes Squid to send
#	an extra CRLF pair after the body of a PUT/POST request.
#
#	Some HTTP servers has broken implementations of PUT/POST,
#	and rely on an extra CRLF pair sent by some WWW clients.
#
#	Quote from RFC2616 section 4.1 on this matter:
#
#	  Note: certain buggy HTTP/1.0 client implementations generate an
#	  extra CRLF's after a POST request. To restate what is explicitly
#	  forbidden by the BNF, an HTTP/1.1 client must not preface or follow
#	  a request with an extra CRLF.
#
#	This clause only supports fast acl types.
#	See http://wiki.squid-cache.org/SquidFaq/SquidAcl for details.
#
#Example:
# acl buggy_server url_regex ^http://....
# broken_posts allow buggy_server
#Default:
# Obey RFC 2616.

#  TAG: adaptation_uses_indirect_client	on|off
#	Controls whether the indirect client IP address (instead of the direct
#	client IP address) is passed to adaptation services.
#
#	See also: follow_x_forwarded_for adaptation_send_client_ip
#Default:
# adaptation_uses_indirect_client on

#  TAG: via	on|off
#	If set (default), Squid will include a Via header in requests and
#	replies as required by RFC2616.
#Default:
# via on

#  TAG: ie_refresh	on|off
#	Microsoft Internet Explorer up until version 5.5 Service
#	Pack 1 has an issue with transparent proxies, wherein it
#	is impossible to force a refresh.  Turning this on provides
#	a partial fix to the problem, by causing all IMS-REFRESH
#	requests from older IE versions to check the origin server
#	for fresh content.  This reduces hit ratio by some amount
#	(~10% in my experience), but allows users to actually get
#	fresh content when they want it.  Note because Squid
#	cannot tell if the user is using 5.5 or 5.5SP1, the behavior
#	of 5.5 is unchanged from old versions of Squid (i.e. a
#	forced refresh is impossible).  Newer versions of IE will,
#	hopefully, continue to have the new behavior and will be
#	handled based on that assumption.  This option defaults to
#	the old Squid behavior, which is better for hit ratios but
#	worse for clients using IE, if they need to be able to
#	force fresh content.
#Default:
# ie_refresh off

#  TAG: vary_ignore_expire	on|off
#	Many HTTP servers supporting Vary gives such objects
#	immediate expiry time with no cache-control header
#	when requested by a HTTP/1.0 client. This option
#	enables Squid to ignore such expiry times until
#	HTTP/1.1 is fully implemented.
#
#	WARNING: If turned on this may eventually cause some
#	varying objects not intended for caching to get cached.
#Default:
# vary_ignore_expire off

#  TAG: request_entities
#	Squid defaults to deny GET and HEAD requests with request entities,
#	as the meaning of such requests are undefined in the HTTP standard
#	even if not explicitly forbidden.
#
#	Set this directive to on if you have clients which insists
#	on sending request entities in GET or HEAD requests. But be warned
#	that there is server software (both proxies and web servers) which
#	can fail to properly process this kind of request which may make you
#	vulnerable to cache pollution attacks if enabled.
#Default:
# request_entities off

#  TAG: request_header_access
#	Usage: request_header_access header_name allow|deny [!]aclname ...
#
#	WARNING: Doing this VIOLATES the HTTP standard.  Enabling
#	this feature could make you liable for problems which it
#	causes.
#
#	This option replaces the old 'anonymize_headers' and the
#	older 'http_anonymizer' option with something that is much
#	more configurable. A list of ACLs for each header name allows
#	removal of specific header fields under specific conditions.
#
#	This option only applies to outgoing HTTP request headers (i.e.,
#	headers sent by Squid to the next HTTP hop such as a cache peer
#	or an origin server). The option has no effect during cache hit
#	detection. The equivalent adaptation vectoring point in ICAP
#	terminology is post-cache REQMOD.
#
#	The option is applied to individual outgoing request header
#	fields. For each request header field F, Squid uses the first
#	qualifying sets of request_header_access rules:
#
#	    1. Rules with header_name equal to F's name.
#	    2. Rules with header_name 'Other', provided F's name is not
#	       on the hard-coded list of commonly used HTTP header names.
#	    3. Rules with header_name 'All'.
#
#	Within that qualifying rule set, rule ACLs are checked as usual.
#	If ACLs of an "allow" rule match, the header field is allowed to
#	go through as is. If ACLs of a "deny" rule match, the header is
#	removed and request_header_replace is then checked to identify
#	if the removed header has a replacement. If no rules within the
#	set have matching ACLs, the header field is left as is.
#
#	For example, to achieve the same behavior as the old
#	'http_anonymizer standard' option, you should use:
#
#		request_header_access From deny all
#		request_header_access Referer deny all
#		request_header_access User-Agent deny all
#
#	Or, to reproduce the old 'http_anonymizer paranoid' feature
#	you should use:
#
#		request_header_access Authorization allow all
#		request_header_access Proxy-Authorization allow all
#		request_header_access Cache-Control allow all
#		request_header_access Content-Length allow all
#		request_header_access Content-Type allow all
#		request_header_access Date allow all
#		request_header_access Host allow all
#		request_header_access If-Modified-Since allow all
#		request_header_access Pragma allow all
#		request_header_access Accept allow all
#		request_header_access Accept-Charset allow all
#		request_header_access Accept-Encoding allow all
#		request_header_access Accept-Language allow all
#		request_header_access Connection allow all
#		request_header_access All deny all
#
#	HTTP reply headers are controlled with the reply_header_access directive.
#
#	By default, all headers are allowed (no anonymizing is performed).
#Default:
# No limits.

#  TAG: reply_header_access
#	Usage: reply_header_access header_name allow|deny [!]aclname ...
#
#	WARNING: Doing this VIOLATES the HTTP standard.  Enabling
#	this feature could make you liable for problems which it
#	causes.
#
#	This option only applies to reply headers, i.e., from the
#	server to the client.
#
#	This is the same as request_header_access, but in the other
#	direction. Please see request_header_access for detailed
#	documentation.
#
#	For example, to achieve the same behavior as the old
#	'http_anonymizer standard' option, you should use:
#
#		reply_header_access Server deny all
#		reply_header_access WWW-Authenticate deny all
#		reply_header_access Link deny all
#
#	Or, to reproduce the old 'http_anonymizer paranoid' feature
#	you should use:
#
#		reply_header_access Allow allow all
#		reply_header_access WWW-Authenticate allow all
#		reply_header_access Proxy-Authenticate allow all
#		reply_header_access Cache-Control allow all
#		reply_header_access Content-Encoding allow all
#		reply_header_access Content-Length allow all
#		reply_header_access Content-Type allow all
#		reply_header_access Date allow all
#		reply_header_access Expires allow all
#		reply_header_access Last-Modified allow all
#		reply_header_access Location allow all
#		reply_header_access Pragma allow all
#		reply_header_access Content-Language allow all
#		reply_header_access Retry-After allow all
#		reply_header_access Title allow all
#		reply_header_access Content-Disposition allow all
#		reply_header_access Connection allow all
#		reply_header_access All deny all
#
#	HTTP request headers are controlled with the request_header_access directive.
#
#	By default, all headers are allowed (no anonymizing is
#	performed).
#Default:
# No limits.

#  TAG: request_header_replace
#	Usage:   request_header_replace header_name message
#	Example: request_header_replace User-Agent Nutscrape/1.0 (CP/M; 8-bit)
#
#	This option allows you to change the contents of headers
#	denied with request_header_access above, by replacing them
#	with some fixed string.
#
#	This only applies to request headers, not reply headers.
#
#	By default, headers are removed if denied.
#Default:
# none

#  TAG: reply_header_replace
#        Usage:   reply_header_replace header_name message
#        Example: reply_header_replace Server Foo/1.0
#
#        This option allows you to change the contents of headers
#        denied with reply_header_access above, by replacing them
#        with some fixed string.
#
#        This only applies to reply headers, not request headers.
#
#        By default, headers are removed if denied.
#Default:
# none

#  TAG: request_header_add
#	Usage:   request_header_add field-name field-value acl1 [acl2] ...
#	Example: request_header_add X-Client-CA "CA=%ssl::>cert_issuer" all
#
#	This option adds header fields to outgoing HTTP requests (i.e.,
#	request headers sent by Squid to the next HTTP hop such as a
#	cache peer or an origin server). The option has no effect during
#	cache hit detection. The equivalent adaptation vectoring point
#	in ICAP terminology is post-cache REQMOD.
#
#	Field-name is a token specifying an HTTP header name. If a
#	standard HTTP header name is used, Squid does not check whether
#	the new header conflicts with any existing headers or violates
#	HTTP rules. If the request to be modified already contains a
#	field with the same name, the old field is preserved but the
#	header field values are not merged.
#
#	Field-value is either a token or a quoted string. If quoted
#	string format is used, then the surrounding quotes are removed
#	while escape sequences and %macros are processed.
#
#	In theory, all of the logformat codes can be used as %macros.
#	However, unlike logging (which happens at the very end of
#	transaction lifetime), the transaction may not yet have enough
#	information to expand a macro when the new header value is needed.
#	And some information may already be available to Squid but not yet
#	committed where the macro expansion code can access it (report
#	such instances!). The macro will be expanded into a single dash
#	('-') in such cases. Not all macros have been tested.
#
#	One or more Squid ACLs may be specified to restrict header
#	injection to matching requests. As always in squid.conf, all
#	ACLs in an option ACL list must be satisfied for the insertion
#	to happen. The request_header_add option supports fast ACLs
#	only.
#Default:
# none

#  TAG: note
#	This option used to log custom information about the master
#	transaction. For example, an admin may configure Squid to log
#	which "user group" the transaction belongs to, where "user group"
#	will be determined based on a set of ACLs and not [just]
#	authentication information.
#	Values of key/value pairs can be logged using %{key}note macros:
#
#	    note key value acl ...
#	    logformat myFormat ... %{key}note ...
#Default:
# none

#  TAG: relaxed_header_parser	on|off|warn
#	In the default "on" setting Squid accepts certain forms
#	of non-compliant HTTP messages where it is unambiguous
#	what the sending application intended even if the message
#	is not correctly formatted. The messages is then normalized
#	to the correct form when forwarded by Squid.
#
#	If set to "warn" then a warning will be emitted in cache.log
#	each time such HTTP error is encountered.
#
#	If set to "off" then such HTTP errors will cause the request
#	or response to be rejected.
#Default:
# relaxed_header_parser on

#  TAG: collapsed_forwarding	(on|off)
#       When enabled, instead of forwarding each concurrent request for
#       the same URL, Squid just sends the first of them. The other, so
#       called "collapsed" requests, wait for the response to the first
#       request and, if it happens to be cachable, use that response.
#       Here, "concurrent requests" means "received after the first
#       request headers were parsed and before the corresponding response
#       headers were parsed".
#
#       This feature is disabled by default: enabling collapsed
#       forwarding needlessly delays forwarding requests that look
#       cachable (when they are collapsed) but then need to be forwarded
#       individually anyway because they end up being for uncachable
#       content. However, in some cases, such as acceleration of highly
#       cachable content with periodic or grouped expiration times, the
#       gains from collapsing [large volumes of simultaneous refresh
#       requests] outweigh losses from such delays.
#
#       Squid collapses two kinds of requests: regular client requests
#       received on one of the listening ports and internal "cache
#       revalidation" requests which are triggered by those regular
#       requests hitting a stale cached object. Revalidation collapsing
#       is currently disabled for Squid instances containing SMP-aware
#       disk or memory caches and for Vary-controlled cached objects.
#Default:
# collapsed_forwarding off

# TIMEOUTS
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

#  TAG: forward_timeout	time-units
#	This parameter specifies how long Squid should at most attempt in
#	finding a forwarding path for the request before giving up.
#Default:
# forward_timeout 4 minutes

#  TAG: connect_timeout	time-units
#	This parameter specifies how long to wait for the TCP connect to
#	the requested server or peer to complete before Squid should
#	attempt to find another path where to forward the request.
#Default:
# connect_timeout 1 minute

#  TAG: peer_connect_timeout	time-units
#	This parameter specifies how long to wait for a pending TCP
#	connection to a peer cache.  The default is 30 seconds.   You
#	may also set different timeout values for individual neighbors
#	with the 'connect-timeout' option on a 'cache_peer' line.
#Default:
# peer_connect_timeout 30 seconds

#  TAG: read_timeout	time-units
#	Applied on peer server connections.
#
#	After each successful read(), the timeout will be extended by this
#	amount.  If no data is read again after this amount of time,
#	the request is aborted and logged with ERR_READ_TIMEOUT.
#
#	The default is 15 minutes.
#Default:
# read_timeout 15 minutes

#  TAG: write_timeout	time-units
#	This timeout is tracked for all connections that have data
#	available for writing and are waiting for the socket to become
#	ready. After each successful write, the timeout is extended by
#	the configured amount. If Squid has data to write but the
#	connection is not ready for the configured duration, the
#	transaction associated with the connection is terminated. The
#	default is 15 minutes.
#Default:
# write_timeout 15 minutes

#  TAG: request_timeout
#	How long to wait for complete HTTP request headers after initial
#	connection establishment.
#Default:
# request_timeout 5 minutes

#  TAG: client_idle_pconn_timeout
#	How long to wait for the next HTTP request on a persistent
#	client connection after the previous request completes.
#Default:
# client_idle_pconn_timeout 2 minutes

#  TAG: ftp_client_idle_timeout
#	How long to wait for an FTP request on a connection to Squid ftp_port.
#	Many FTP clients do not deal with idle connection closures well,
#	necessitating a longer default timeout than client_idle_pconn_timeout
#	used for incoming HTTP requests.
#Default:
# ftp_client_idle_timeout 30 minutes

#  TAG: client_lifetime	time-units
#	The maximum amount of time a client (browser) is allowed to
#	remain connected to the cache process.  This protects the Cache
#	from having a lot of sockets (and hence file descriptors) tied up
#	in a CLOSE_WAIT state from remote clients that go away without
#	properly shutting down (either because of a network failure or
#	because of a poor client implementation).  The default is one
#	day, 1440 minutes.
#
#	NOTE:  The default value is intended to be much larger than any
#	client would ever need to be connected to your cache.  You
#	should probably change client_lifetime only as a last resort.
#	If you seem to have many client connections tying up
#	filedescriptors, we recommend first tuning the read_timeout,
#	request_timeout, persistent_request_timeout and quick_abort values.
#Default:
# client_lifetime 1 day

#  TAG: half_closed_clients
#	Some clients may shutdown the sending side of their TCP
#	connections, while leaving their receiving sides open.	Sometimes,
#	Squid can not tell the difference between a half-closed and a
#	fully-closed TCP connection.
#
#	By default, Squid will immediately close client connections when
#	read(2) returns "no more data to read."
#
#	Change this option to 'on' and Squid will keep open connections
#	until a read(2) or write(2) on the socket returns an error.
#	This may show some benefits for reverse proxies. But if not
#	it is recommended to leave OFF.
#Default:
# half_closed_clients off

#  TAG: server_idle_pconn_timeout
#	Timeout for idle persistent connections to servers and other
#	proxies.
#Default:
# server_idle_pconn_timeout 1 minute

#  TAG: ident_timeout
#	Maximum time to wait for IDENT lookups to complete.
#
#	If this is too high, and you enabled IDENT lookups from untrusted
#	users, you might be susceptible to denial-of-service by having
#	many ident requests going at once.
#Default:
# ident_timeout 10 seconds

#  TAG: shutdown_lifetime	time-units
#	When SIGTERM or SIGHUP is received, the cache is put into
#	"shutdown pending" mode until all active sockets are closed.
#	This value is the lifetime to set for all open descriptors
#	during shutdown mode.  Any active clients after this many
#	seconds will receive a 'timeout' message.
#Default:
# shutdown_lifetime 30 seconds

# ADMINISTRATIVE PARAMETERS
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

#  TAG: cache_mgr
#	Email-address of local cache manager who will receive
#	mail if the cache dies.  The default is "webmaster".
#Default:
# cache_mgr webmaster

#  TAG: mail_from
#	From: email-address for mail sent when the cache dies.
#	The default is to use 'squid@unique_hostname'.
#
#	See also: unique_hostname directive.
#Default:
# none

#  TAG: mail_program
#	Email program used to send mail if the cache dies.
#	The default is "mail". The specified program must comply
#	with the standard Unix mail syntax:
#	  mail-program recipient < mailfile
#
#	Optional command line options can be specified.
#Default:
# mail_program mail

#  TAG: cache_effective_user
#	If you start Squid as root, it will change its effective/real
#	UID/GID to the user specified below.  The default is to change
#	to UID of proxy.
#	see also; cache_effective_group
#Default:
# cache_effective_user proxy

#  TAG: cache_effective_group
#	Squid sets the GID to the effective user's default group ID
#	(taken from the password file) and supplementary group list
#	from the groups membership.
#
#	If you want Squid to run with a specific GID regardless of
#	the group memberships of the effective user then set this
#	to the group (or GID) you want Squid to run as. When set
#	all other group privileges of the effective user are ignored
#	and only this GID is effective. If Squid is not started as
#	root the user starting Squid MUST be member of the specified
#	group.
#
#	This option is not recommended by the Squid Team.
#	Our preference is for administrators to configure a secure
#	user account for squid with UID/GID matching system policies.
#Default:
# Use system group memberships of the cache_effective_user account

#  TAG: httpd_suppress_version_string	on|off
#	Suppress Squid version string info in HTTP headers and HTML error pages.
#Default:
# httpd_suppress_version_string off

#  TAG: visible_hostname
#	If you want to present a special hostname in error messages, etc,
#	define this.  Otherwise, the return value of gethostname()
#	will be used. If you have multiple caches in a cluster and
#	get errors about IP-forwarding you must set them to have individual
#	names with this setting.
#Default:
# Automatically detect the system host name

#  TAG: unique_hostname
#	If you want to have multiple machines with the same
#	'visible_hostname' you must give each machine a different
#	'unique_hostname' so forwarding loops can be detected.
#Default:
# Copy the value from visible_hostname

#  TAG: hostname_aliases
#	A list of other DNS names your cache has.
#Default:
# none

#  TAG: umask
#	Minimum umask which should be enforced while the proxy
#	is running, in addition to the umask set at startup.
#
#	For a traditional octal representation of umasks, start
#        your value with 0.
#Default:
# umask 027

# OPTIONS FOR THE CACHE REGISTRATION SERVICE
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
#	This section contains parameters for the (optional) cache
#	announcement service.  This service is provided to help
#	cache administrators locate one another in order to join or
#	create cache hierarchies.
#
#	An 'announcement' message is sent (via UDP) to the registration
#	service by Squid.  By default, the announcement message is NOT
#	SENT unless you enable it with 'announce_period' below.
#
#	The announcement message includes your hostname, plus the
#	following information from this configuration file:
#
#		http_port
#		icp_port
#		cache_mgr
#
#	All current information is processed regularly and made
#	available on the Web at http://www.ircache.net/Cache/Tracker/.

#  TAG: announce_period
#	This is how frequently to send cache announcements.
#
#	To enable announcing your cache, just set an announce period.
#
#	Example:
#		announce_period 1 day
#Default:
# Announcement messages disabled.

#  TAG: announce_host
#	Set the hostname where announce registration messages will be sent.
#
#	See also announce_port and announce_file
#Default:
# announce_host tracker.ircache.net

#  TAG: announce_file
#	The contents of this file will be included in the announce
#	registration messages.
#Default:
# none

#  TAG: announce_port
#	Set the port where announce registration messages will be sent.
#
#	See also announce_host and announce_file
#Default:
# announce_port 3131

# HTTPD-ACCELERATOR OPTIONS
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

#  TAG: httpd_accel_surrogate_id
#	Surrogates (http://www.esi.org/architecture_spec_1.0.html)
#	need an identification token to allow control targeting. Because
#	a farm of surrogates may all perform the same tasks, they may share
#	an identification token.
#Default:
# visible_hostname is used if no specific ID is set.

#  TAG: http_accel_surrogate_remote	on|off
#	Remote surrogates (such as those in a CDN) honour the header
#	"Surrogate-Control: no-store-remote".
#
#	Set this to on to have squid behave as a remote surrogate.
#Default:
# http_accel_surrogate_remote off

#  TAG: esi_parser	libxml2|expat|custom
#	ESI markup is not strictly XML compatible. The custom ESI parser
#	will give higher performance, but cannot handle non ASCII character
#	encodings.
#Default:
# esi_parser custom

# DELAY POOL PARAMETERS
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

#  TAG: delay_pools
#	This represents the number of delay pools to be used.  For example,
#	if you have one class 2 delay pool and one class 3 delays pool, you
#	have a total of 2 delay pools.
#
#	See also delay_parameters, delay_class, delay_access for pool
#	configuration details.
#Default:
# delay_pools 0

#  TAG: delay_class
#	This defines the class of each delay pool.  There must be exactly one
#	delay_class line for each delay pool.  For example, to define two
#	delay pools, one of class 2 and one of class 3, the settings above
#	and here would be:
#
#	Example:
#	    delay_pools 4      # 4 delay pools
#	    delay_class 1 2    # pool 1 is a class 2 pool
#	    delay_class 2 3    # pool 2 is a class 3 pool
#	    delay_class 3 4    # pool 3 is a class 4 pool
#	    delay_class 4 5    # pool 4 is a class 5 pool
#
#	The delay pool classes are:
#
#		class 1		Everything is limited by a single aggregate
#				bucket.
#
#		class 2 	Everything is limited by a single aggregate
#				bucket as well as an "individual" bucket chosen
#				from bits 25 through 32 of the IPv4 address.
#
#		class 3		Everything is limited by a single aggregate
#				bucket as well as a "network" bucket chosen
#				from bits 17 through 24 of the IP address and a
#				"individual" bucket chosen from bits 17 through
#				32 of the IPv4 address.
#
#		class 4		Everything in a class 3 delay pool, with an
#				additional limit on a per user basis. This
#				only takes effect if the username is established
#				in advance - by forcing authentication in your
#				http_access rules.
#
#		class 5		Requests are grouped according their tag (see
#				external_acl's tag= reply).
#
#
#	Each pool also requires a delay_parameters directive to configure the pool size
#	and speed limits used whenever the pool is applied to a request. Along with
#	a set of delay_access directives to determine when it is used.
#
#	NOTE: If an IP address is a.b.c.d
#		-> bits 25 through 32 are "d"
#		-> bits 17 through 24 are "c"
#		-> bits 17 through 32 are "c * 256 + d"
#
#	NOTE-2: Due to the use of bitmasks in class 2,3,4 pools they only apply to
#		IPv4 traffic. Class 1 and 5 pools may be used with IPv6 traffic.
#
#	This clause only supports fast acl types.
#	See http://wiki.squid-cache.org/SquidFaq/SquidAcl for details.
#
#	See also delay_parameters and delay_access.
#Default:
# none

#  TAG: delay_access
#	This is used to determine which delay pool a request falls into.
#
#	delay_access is sorted per pool and the matching starts with pool 1,
#	then pool 2, ..., and finally pool N. The first delay pool where the
#	request is allowed is selected for the request. If it does not allow
#	the request to any pool then the request is not delayed (default).
#
#	For example, if you want some_big_clients in delay
#	pool 1 and lotsa_little_clients in delay pool 2:
#
#		delay_access 1 allow some_big_clients
#		delay_access 1 deny all
#		delay_access 2 allow lotsa_little_clients
#		delay_access 2 deny all
#		delay_access 3 allow authenticated_clients
#
#	See also delay_parameters and delay_class.
#
#Default:
# Deny using the pool, unless allow rules exist in squid.conf for the pool.

#  TAG: delay_parameters
#	This defines the parameters for a delay pool.  Each delay pool has
#	a number of "buckets" associated with it, as explained in the
#	description of delay_class.
#
#	For a class 1 delay pool, the syntax is:
#		delay_class pool 1
#		delay_parameters pool aggregate
#
#	For a class 2 delay pool:
#		delay_class pool 2
#		delay_parameters pool aggregate individual
#
#	For a class 3 delay pool:
#		delay_class pool 3
#		delay_parameters pool aggregate network individual
#
#	For a class 4 delay pool:
#		delay_class pool 4
#		delay_parameters pool aggregate network individual user
#
#	For a class 5 delay pool:
#		delay_class pool 5
#		delay_parameters pool tagrate
#
#	The option variables are:
#
#		pool		a pool number - ie, a number between 1 and the
#				number specified in delay_pools as used in
#				delay_class lines.
#
#		aggregate	the speed limit parameters for the aggregate bucket
#				(class 1, 2, 3).
#
#		individual	the speed limit parameters for the individual
#				buckets (class 2, 3).
#
#		network		the speed limit parameters for the network buckets
#				(class 3).
#
#		user		the speed limit parameters for the user buckets
#				(class 4).
#
#		tagrate		the speed limit parameters for the tag buckets
#				(class 5).
#
#	A pair of delay parameters is written restore/maximum, where restore is
#	the number of bytes (not bits - modem and network speeds are usually
#	quoted in bits) per second placed into the bucket, and maximum is the
#	maximum number of bytes which can be in the bucket at any time.
#
#	There must be one delay_parameters line for each delay pool.
#
#
#	For example, if delay pool number 1 is a class 2 delay pool as in the
#	above example, and is being used to strictly limit each host to 64Kbit/sec
#	(plus overheads), with no overall limit, the line is:
#
#		delay_parameters 1 none 8000/8000
#
#	Note that 8 x 8K Byte/sec -> 64K bit/sec.
#
#	Note that the word 'none' is used to represent no limit.
#
#
#	And, if delay pool number 2 is a class 3 delay pool as in the above
#	example, and you want to limit it to a total of 256Kbit/sec (strict limit)
#	with each 8-bit network permitted 64Kbit/sec (strict limit) and each
#	individual host permitted 4800bit/sec with a bucket maximum size of 64Kbits
#	to permit a decent web page to be downloaded at a decent speed
#	(if the network is not being limited due to overuse) but slow down
#	large downloads more significantly:
#
#		delay_parameters 2 32000/32000 8000/8000 600/8000
#
#	Note that 8 x  32K Byte/sec ->  256K bit/sec.
#		  8 x   8K Byte/sec ->   64K bit/sec.
#		  8 x 600  Byte/sec -> 4800  bit/sec.
#
#
#	Finally, for a class 4 delay pool as in the example - each user will
#	be limited to 128Kbits/sec no matter how many workstations they are logged into.:
#
#		delay_parameters 4 32000/32000 8000/8000 600/64000 16000/16000
#
#
#	See also delay_class and delay_access.
#
#Default:
# none

#  TAG: delay_initial_bucket_level	(percent, 0-100)
#	The initial bucket percentage is used to determine how much is put
#	in each bucket when squid starts, is reconfigured, or first notices
#	a host accessing it (in class 2 and class 3, individual hosts and
#	networks only have buckets associated with them once they have been
#	"seen" by squid).
#Default:
# delay_initial_bucket_level 50

# CLIENT DELAY POOL PARAMETERS
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

#  TAG: client_delay_pools
#	This option specifies the number of client delay pools used. It must
#	preceed other client_delay_* options.
#
#	Example:
#		client_delay_pools 2
#
#	See also client_delay_parameters and client_delay_access.
#Default:
# client_delay_pools 0

#  TAG: client_delay_initial_bucket_level	(percent, 0-no_limit)
#	This option determines the initial bucket size as a percentage of
#	max_bucket_size from client_delay_parameters. Buckets are created
#	at the time of the "first" connection from the matching IP. Idle
#	buckets are periodically deleted up.
#
#	You can specify more than 100 percent but note that such "oversized"
#	buckets are not refilled until their size goes down to max_bucket_size
#	from client_delay_parameters.
#
#	Example:
#		client_delay_initial_bucket_level 50
#Default:
# client_delay_initial_bucket_level 50

#  TAG: client_delay_parameters
#
#	This option configures client-side bandwidth limits using the
#	following format:
#
#	    client_delay_parameters pool speed_limit max_bucket_size
#
#	pool is an integer ID used for client_delay_access matching.
#
#	speed_limit is bytes added to the bucket per second.
#
#	max_bucket_size is the maximum size of a bucket, enforced after any
#	speed_limit additions.
#
#	Please see the delay_parameters option for more information and
#	examples.
#
#	Example:
#		client_delay_parameters 1 1024 2048
#		client_delay_parameters 2 51200 16384
#
#	See also client_delay_access.
#
#Default:
# none

#  TAG: client_delay_access
#	This option determines the client-side delay pool for the
#	request:
#
#	    client_delay_access pool_ID allow|deny acl_name
#
#	All client_delay_access options are checked in their pool ID
#	order, starting with pool 1. The first checked pool with allowed
#	request is selected for the request. If no ACL matches or there
#	are no client_delay_access options, the request bandwidth is not
#	limited.
#
#	The ACL-selected pool is then used to find the
#	client_delay_parameters for the request. Client-side pools are
#	not used to aggregate clients. Clients are always aggregated
#	based on their source IP addresses (one bucket per source IP).
#
#	This clause only supports fast acl types.
#	See http://wiki.squid-cache.org/SquidFaq/SquidAcl for details.
#	Additionally, only the client TCP connection details are available.
#	ACLs testing HTTP properties will not work.
#
#	Please see delay_access for more examples.
#
#	Example:
#		client_delay_access 1 allow low_rate_network
#		client_delay_access 2 allow vips_network
#
#
#	See also client_delay_parameters and client_delay_pools.
#Default:
# Deny use of the pool, unless allow rules exist in squid.conf for the pool.

# WCCPv1 AND WCCPv2 CONFIGURATION OPTIONS
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

#  TAG: wccp_router
#	Use this option to define your WCCP ``home'' router for
#	Squid.
#
#	wccp_router supports a single WCCP(v1) router
#
#	wccp2_router supports multiple WCCPv2 routers
#
#	only one of the two may be used at the same time and defines
#	which version of WCCP to use.
#Default:
# WCCP disabled.

#  TAG: wccp2_router
#	Use this option to define your WCCP ``home'' router for
#	Squid.
#
#	wccp_router supports a single WCCP(v1) router
#
#	wccp2_router supports multiple WCCPv2 routers
#
#	only one of the two may be used at the same time and defines
#	which version of WCCP to use.
#Default:
# WCCPv2 disabled.

#  TAG: wccp_version
#	This directive is only relevant if you need to set up WCCP(v1)
#	to some very old and end-of-life Cisco routers. In all other
#	setups it must be left unset or at the default setting.
#	It defines an internal version in the WCCP(v1) protocol,
#	with version 4 being the officially documented protocol.
#
#	According to some users, Cisco IOS 11.2 and earlier only
#	support WCCP version 3.  If you're using that or an earlier
#	version of IOS, you may need to change this value to 3, otherwise
#	do not specify this parameter.
#Default:
# wccp_version 4

#  TAG: wccp2_rebuild_wait
#	If this is enabled Squid will wait for the cache dir rebuild to finish
#	before sending the first wccp2 HereIAm packet
#Default:
# wccp2_rebuild_wait on

#  TAG: wccp2_forwarding_method
#	WCCP2 allows the setting of forwarding methods between the
#	router/switch and the cache.  Valid values are as follows:
#
#	gre - GRE encapsulation (forward the packet in a GRE/WCCP tunnel)
#	l2  - L2 redirect (forward the packet using Layer 2/MAC rewriting)
#
#	Currently (as of IOS 12.4) cisco routers only support GRE.
#	Cisco switches only support the L2 redirect assignment method.
#Default:
# wccp2_forwarding_method gre

#  TAG: wccp2_return_method
#	WCCP2 allows the setting of return methods between the
#	router/switch and the cache for packets that the cache
#	decides not to handle.  Valid values are as follows:
#
#	gre - GRE encapsulation (forward the packet in a GRE/WCCP tunnel)
#	l2  - L2 redirect (forward the packet using Layer 2/MAC rewriting)
#
#	Currently (as of IOS 12.4) cisco routers only support GRE.
#	Cisco switches only support the L2 redirect assignment.
#
#	If the "ip wccp redirect exclude in" command has been
#	enabled on the cache interface, then it is still safe for
#	the proxy server to use a l2 redirect method even if this
#	option is set to GRE.
#Default:
# wccp2_return_method gre

#  TAG: wccp2_assignment_method
#	WCCP2 allows the setting of methods to assign the WCCP hash
#	Valid values are as follows:
#
#	hash - Hash assignment
#	mask - Mask assignment
#
#	As a general rule, cisco routers support the hash assignment method
#	and cisco switches support the mask assignment method.
#Default:
# wccp2_assignment_method hash

#  TAG: wccp2_service
#	WCCP2 allows for multiple traffic services. There are two
#	types: "standard" and "dynamic". The standard type defines
#	one service id - http (id 0). The dynamic service ids can be from
#	51 to 255 inclusive.  In order to use a dynamic service id
#	one must define the type of traffic to be redirected; this is done
#	using the wccp2_service_info option.
#
#	The "standard" type does not require a wccp2_service_info option,
#	just specifying the service id will suffice.
#
#	MD5 service authentication can be enabled by adding
#	"password=<password>" to the end of this service declaration.
#
#	Examples:
#
#	wccp2_service standard 0	# for the 'web-cache' standard service
#	wccp2_service dynamic 80	# a dynamic service type which will be
#					# fleshed out with subsequent options.
#	wccp2_service standard 0 password=foo
#Default:
# Use the 'web-cache' standard service.

#  TAG: wccp2_service_info
#	Dynamic WCCPv2 services require further information to define the
#	traffic you wish to have diverted.
#
#	The format is:
#
#	wccp2_service_info <id> protocol=<protocol> flags=<flag>,<flag>..
#	    priority=<priority> ports=<port>,<port>..
#
#	The relevant WCCPv2 flags:
#	+ src_ip_hash, dst_ip_hash
#	+ source_port_hash, dst_port_hash
#	+ src_ip_alt_hash, dst_ip_alt_hash
#	+ src_port_alt_hash, dst_port_alt_hash
#	+ ports_source
#
#	The port list can be one to eight entries.
#
#	Example:
#
#	wccp2_service_info 80 protocol=tcp flags=src_ip_hash,ports_source
#	    priority=240 ports=80
#
#	Note: the service id must have been defined by a previous
#	'wccp2_service dynamic <id>' entry.
#Default:
# none

#  TAG: wccp2_weight
#	Each cache server gets assigned a set of the destination
#	hash proportional to their weight.
#Default:
# wccp2_weight 10000

#  TAG: wccp_address
#	Use this option if you require WCCPv2 to use a specific
#	interface address.
#
#	The default behavior is to not bind to any specific address.
#Default:
# Address selected by the operating system.

#  TAG: wccp2_address
#	Use this option if you require WCCP to use a specific
#	interface address.
#
#	The default behavior is to not bind to any specific address.
#Default:
# Address selected by the operating system.

# PERSISTENT CONNECTION HANDLING
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Also see "pconn_timeout" in the TIMEOUTS section

#  TAG: client_persistent_connections
#	Persistent connection support for clients.
#	Squid uses persistent connections (when allowed). You can use
#	this option to disable persistent connections with clients.
#Default:
# client_persistent_connections on

#  TAG: server_persistent_connections
#	Persistent connection support for servers.
#	Squid uses persistent connections (when allowed). You can use
#	this option to disable persistent connections with servers.
#Default:
# server_persistent_connections on

#  TAG: persistent_connection_after_error
#	With this directive the use of persistent connections after
#	HTTP errors can be disabled. Useful if you have clients
#	who fail to handle errors on persistent connections proper.
#Default:
# persistent_connection_after_error on

#  TAG: detect_broken_pconn
#	Some servers have been found to incorrectly signal the use
#	of HTTP/1.0 persistent connections even on replies not
#	compatible, causing significant delays. This server problem
#	has mostly been seen on redirects.
#
#	By enabling this directive Squid attempts to detect such
#	broken replies and automatically assume the reply is finished
#	after 10 seconds timeout.
#Default:
# detect_broken_pconn off

# CACHE DIGEST OPTIONS
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

#  TAG: digest_generation
#	This controls whether the server will generate a Cache Digest
#	of its contents.  By default, Cache Digest generation is
#	enabled if Squid is compiled with --enable-cache-digests defined.
#Default:
# digest_generation on

#  TAG: digest_bits_per_entry
#	This is the number of bits of the server's Cache Digest which
#	will be associated with the Digest entry for a given HTTP
#	Method and URL (public key) combination.  The default is 5.
#Default:
# digest_bits_per_entry 5

#  TAG: digest_rebuild_period	(seconds)
#	This is the wait time between Cache Digest rebuilds.
#Default:
# digest_rebuild_period 1 hour

#  TAG: digest_rewrite_period	(seconds)
#	This is the wait time between Cache Digest writes to
#	disk.
#Default:
# digest_rewrite_period 1 hour

#  TAG: digest_swapout_chunk_size	(bytes)
#	This is the number of bytes of the Cache Digest to write to
#	disk at a time.  It defaults to 4096 bytes (4KB), the Squid
#	default swap page.
#Default:
# digest_swapout_chunk_size 4096 bytes

#  TAG: digest_rebuild_chunk_percentage	(percent, 0-100)
#	This is the percentage of the Cache Digest to be scanned at a
#	time.  By default it is set to 10% of the Cache Digest.
#Default:
# digest_rebuild_chunk_percentage 10

# SNMP OPTIONS
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

#  TAG: snmp_port
#	The port number where Squid listens for SNMP requests. To enable
#	SNMP support set this to a suitable port number. Port number
#	3401 is often used for the Squid SNMP agent. By default it's
#	set to "0" (disabled)
#
#	Example:
#		snmp_port 3401
#Default:
# SNMP disabled.

#  TAG: snmp_access
#	Allowing or denying access to the SNMP port.
#
#	All access to the agent is denied by default.
#	usage:
#
#	snmp_access allow|deny [!]aclname ...
#
#	This clause only supports fast acl types.
#	See http://wiki.squid-cache.org/SquidFaq/SquidAcl for details.
#
#Example:
# snmp_access allow snmppublic localhost
# snmp_access deny all
#Default:
# Deny, unless rules exist in squid.conf.

#  TAG: snmp_incoming_address
#	Just like 'udp_incoming_address', but for the SNMP port.
#
#	snmp_incoming_address	is used for the SNMP socket receiving
#				messages from SNMP agents.
#
#	The default snmp_incoming_address is to listen on all
#	available network interfaces.
#Default:
# Accept SNMP packets from all machine interfaces.

#  TAG: snmp_outgoing_address
#	Just like 'udp_outgoing_address', but for the SNMP port.
#
#	snmp_outgoing_address	is used for SNMP packets returned to SNMP
#				agents.
#
#	If snmp_outgoing_address is not set it will use the same socket
#	as snmp_incoming_address. Only change this if you want to have
#	SNMP replies sent using another address than where this Squid
#	listens for SNMP queries.
#
#	NOTE, snmp_incoming_address and snmp_outgoing_address can not have
#	the same value since they both use the same port.
#Default:
# Use snmp_incoming_address or an address selected by the operating system.

# ICP OPTIONS
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

#  TAG: icp_port
#	The port number where Squid sends and receives ICP queries to
#	and from neighbor caches.  The standard UDP port for ICP is 3130.
#
#	Example:
#		icp_port 3130
#Default:
# ICP disabled.

#  TAG: htcp_port
#	The port number where Squid sends and receives HTCP queries to
#	and from neighbor caches.  To turn it on you want to set it to
#	4827.
#
#	Example:
#		htcp_port 4827
#Default:
# HTCP disabled.

#  TAG: log_icp_queries	on|off
#	If set, ICP queries are logged to access.log. You may wish
#	do disable this if your ICP load is VERY high to speed things
#	up or to simplify log analysis.
#Default:
# log_icp_queries on

#  TAG: udp_incoming_address
#	udp_incoming_address	is used for UDP packets received from other
#				caches.
#
#	The default behavior is to not bind to any specific address.
#
#	Only change this if you want to have all UDP queries received on
#	a specific interface/address.
#
#	NOTE: udp_incoming_address is used by the ICP, HTCP, and DNS
#	modules. Altering it will affect all of them in the same manner.
#
#	see also; udp_outgoing_address
#
#	NOTE, udp_incoming_address and udp_outgoing_address can not
#	have the same value since they both use the same port.
#Default:
# Accept packets from all machine interfaces.

#  TAG: udp_outgoing_address
#	udp_outgoing_address	is used for UDP packets sent out to other
#				caches.
#
#	The default behavior is to not bind to any specific address.
#
#	Instead it will use the same socket as udp_incoming_address.
#	Only change this if you want to have UDP queries sent using another
#	address than where this Squid listens for UDP queries from other
#	caches.
#
#	NOTE: udp_outgoing_address is used by the ICP, HTCP, and DNS
#	modules. Altering it will affect all of them in the same manner.
#
#	see also; udp_incoming_address
#
#	NOTE, udp_incoming_address and udp_outgoing_address can not
#	have the same value since they both use the same port.
#Default:
# Use udp_incoming_address or an address selected by the operating system.

#  TAG: icp_hit_stale	on|off
#	If you want to return ICP_HIT for stale cache objects, set this
#	option to 'on'.  If you have sibling relationships with caches
#	in other administrative domains, this should be 'off'.  If you only
#	have sibling relationships with caches under your control,
#	it is probably okay to set this to 'on'.
#	If set to 'on', your siblings should use the option "allow-miss"
#	on their cache_peer lines for connecting to you.
#Default:
# icp_hit_stale off

#  TAG: minimum_direct_hops
#	If using the ICMP pinging stuff, do direct fetches for sites
#	which are no more than this many hops away.
#Default:
# minimum_direct_hops 4

#  TAG: minimum_direct_rtt	(msec)
#	If using the ICMP pinging stuff, do direct fetches for sites
#	which are no more than this many rtt milliseconds away.
#Default:
# minimum_direct_rtt 400

#  TAG: netdb_low
#	The low water mark for the ICMP measurement database.
#
#	Note: high watermark controlled by netdb_high directive.
#
#	These watermarks are counts, not percents.  The defaults are
#	(low) 900 and (high) 1000.  When the high water mark is
#	reached, database entries will be deleted until the low
#	mark is reached.
#Default:
# netdb_low 900

#  TAG: netdb_high
#	The high water mark for the ICMP measurement database.
#
#	Note: low watermark controlled by netdb_low directive.
#
#	These watermarks are counts, not percents.  The defaults are
#	(low) 900 and (high) 1000.  When the high water mark is
#	reached, database entries will be deleted until the low
#	mark is reached.
#Default:
# netdb_high 1000

#  TAG: netdb_ping_period
#	The minimum period for measuring a site.  There will be at
#	least this much delay between successive pings to the same
#	network.  The default is five minutes.
#Default:
# netdb_ping_period 5 minutes

#  TAG: query_icmp	on|off
#	If you want to ask your peers to include ICMP data in their ICP
#	replies, enable this option.
#
#	If your peer has configured Squid (during compilation) with
#	'--enable-icmp' that peer will send ICMP pings to origin server
#	sites of the URLs it receives.  If you enable this option the
#	ICP replies from that peer will include the ICMP data (if available).
#	Then, when choosing a parent cache, Squid will choose the parent with
#	the minimal RTT to the origin server.  When this happens, the
#	hierarchy field of the access.log will be
#	"CLOSEST_PARENT_MISS".  This option is off by default.
#Default:
# query_icmp off

#  TAG: test_reachability	on|off
#	When this is 'on', ICP MISS replies will be ICP_MISS_NOFETCH
#	instead of ICP_MISS if the target host is NOT in the ICMP
#	database, or has a zero RTT.
#Default:
# test_reachability off

#  TAG: icp_query_timeout	(msec)
#	Normally Squid will automatically determine an optimal ICP
#	query timeout value based on the round-trip-time of recent ICP
#	queries.  If you want to override the value determined by
#	Squid, set this 'icp_query_timeout' to a non-zero value.  This
#	value is specified in MILLISECONDS, so, to use a 2-second
#	timeout (the old default), you would write:
#
#		icp_query_timeout 2000
#Default:
# Dynamic detection.

#  TAG: maximum_icp_query_timeout	(msec)
#	Normally the ICP query timeout is determined dynamically.  But
#	sometimes it can lead to very large values (say 5 seconds).
#	Use this option to put an upper limit on the dynamic timeout
#	value.  Do NOT use this option to always use a fixed (instead
#	of a dynamic) timeout value. To set a fixed timeout see the
#	'icp_query_timeout' directive.
#Default:
# maximum_icp_query_timeout 2000

#  TAG: minimum_icp_query_timeout	(msec)
#	Normally the ICP query timeout is determined dynamically.  But
#	sometimes it can lead to very small timeouts, even lower than
#	the normal latency variance on your link due to traffic.
#	Use this option to put an lower limit on the dynamic timeout
#	value.  Do NOT use this option to always use a fixed (instead
#	of a dynamic) timeout value. To set a fixed timeout see the
#	'icp_query_timeout' directive.
#Default:
# minimum_icp_query_timeout 5

#  TAG: background_ping_rate	time-units
#	Controls how often the ICP pings are sent to siblings that
#	have background-ping set.
#Default:
# background_ping_rate 10 seconds

# MULTICAST ICP OPTIONS
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

#  TAG: mcast_groups
#	This tag specifies a list of multicast groups which your server
#	should join to receive multicasted ICP queries.
#
#	NOTE!  Be very careful what you put here!  Be sure you
#	understand the difference between an ICP _query_ and an ICP
#	_reply_.  This option is to be set only if you want to RECEIVE
#	multicast queries.  Do NOT set this option to SEND multicast
#	ICP (use cache_peer for that).  ICP replies are always sent via
#	unicast, so this option does not affect whether or not you will
#	receive replies from multicast group members.
#
#	You must be very careful to NOT use a multicast address which
#	is already in use by another group of caches.
#
#	If you are unsure about multicast, please read the Multicast
#	chapter in the Squid FAQ (http://www.squid-cache.org/FAQ/).
#
#	Usage: mcast_groups 239.128.16.128 224.0.1.20
#
#	By default, Squid doesn't listen on any multicast groups.
#Default:
# none

#  TAG: mcast_miss_addr
# Note: This option is only available if Squid is rebuilt with the
#       -DMULTICAST_MISS_STREAM define
#
#	If you enable this option, every "cache miss" URL will
#	be sent out on the specified multicast address.
#
#	Do not enable this option unless you are absolutely
#	certain you understand what you are doing.
#Default:
# disabled.

#  TAG: mcast_miss_ttl
# Note: This option is only available if Squid is rebuilt with the
#       -DMULTICAST_MISS_STREAM define
#
#	This is the time-to-live value for packets multicasted
#	when multicasting off cache miss URLs is enabled.  By
#	default this is set to 'site scope', i.e. 16.
#Default:
# mcast_miss_ttl 16

#  TAG: mcast_miss_port
# Note: This option is only available if Squid is rebuilt with the
#       -DMULTICAST_MISS_STREAM define
#
#	This is the port number to be used in conjunction with
#	'mcast_miss_addr'.
#Default:
# mcast_miss_port 3135

#  TAG: mcast_miss_encode_key
# Note: This option is only available if Squid is rebuilt with the
#       -DMULTICAST_MISS_STREAM define
#
#	The URLs that are sent in the multicast miss stream are
#	encrypted.  This is the encryption key.
#Default:
# mcast_miss_encode_key XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX

#  TAG: mcast_icp_query_timeout	(msec)
#	For multicast peers, Squid regularly sends out ICP "probes" to
#	count how many other peers are listening on the given multicast
#	address.  This value specifies how long Squid should wait to
#	count all the replies.  The default is 2000 msec, or 2
#	seconds.
#Default:
# mcast_icp_query_timeout 2000

# INTERNAL ICON OPTIONS
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

#  TAG: icon_directory
#	Where the icons are stored. These are normally kept in
#	/usr/share/squid/icons
#Default:
# icon_directory /usr/share/squid/icons

#  TAG: global_internal_static
#	This directive controls is Squid should intercept all requests for
#	/squid-internal-static/ no matter which host the URL is requesting
#	(default on setting), or if nothing special should be done for
#	such URLs (off setting). The purpose of this directive is to make
#	icons etc work better in complex cache hierarchies where it may
#	not always be possible for all corners in the cache mesh to reach
#	the server generating a directory listing.
#Default:
# global_internal_static on

#  TAG: short_icon_urls
#	If this is enabled Squid will use short URLs for icons.
#	If disabled it will revert to the old behavior of including
#	it's own name and port in the URL.
#
#	If you run a complex cache hierarchy with a mix of Squid and
#	other proxies you may need to disable this directive.
#Default:
# short_icon_urls on

# ERROR PAGE OPTIONS
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

#  TAG: error_directory
#	If you wish to create your own versions of the default
#	error files to customize them to suit your company copy
#	the error/template files to another directory and point
#	this tag at them.
#
#	WARNING: This option will disable multi-language support
#	         on error pages if used.
#
#	The squid developers are interested in making squid available in
#	a wide variety of languages. If you are making translations for a
#	language that Squid does not currently provide please consider
#	contributing your translation back to the project.
#	http://wiki.squid-cache.org/Translations
#
#	The squid developers working on translations are happy to supply drop-in
#	translated error files in exchange for any new language contributions.
#Default:
# Send error pages in the clients preferred language

#  TAG: error_default_language
#	Set the default language which squid will send error pages in
#	if no existing translation matches the clients language
#	preferences.
#
#	If unset (default) generic English will be used.
#
#	The squid developers are interested in making squid available in
#	a wide variety of languages. If you are interested in making
#	translations for any language see the squid wiki for details.
#	http://wiki.squid-cache.org/Translations
#Default:
# Generate English language pages.

#  TAG: error_log_languages
#	Log to cache.log what languages users are attempting to
#	auto-negotiate for translations.
#
#	Successful negotiations are not logged. Only failures
#	have meaning to indicate that Squid may need an upgrade
#	of its error page translations.
#Default:
# error_log_languages on

#  TAG: err_page_stylesheet
#	CSS Stylesheet to pattern the display of Squid default error pages.
#
#	For information on CSS see http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/
#Default:
# err_page_stylesheet /etc/squid/errorpage.css

#  TAG: err_html_text
#	HTML text to include in error messages.  Make this a "mailto"
#	URL to your admin address, or maybe just a link to your
#	organizations Web page.
#
#	To include this in your error messages, you must rewrite
#	the error template files (found in the "errors" directory).
#	Wherever you want the 'err_html_text' line to appear,
#	insert a %L tag in the error template file.
#Default:
# none

#  TAG: email_err_data	on|off
#	If enabled, information about the occurred error will be
#	included in the mailto links of the ERR pages (if %W is set)
#	so that the email body contains the data.
#	Syntax is <A HREF="mailto:%w%W">%w</A>
#Default:
# email_err_data on

#  TAG: deny_info
#	Usage:   deny_info err_page_name acl
#	or       deny_info http://... acl
#	or       deny_info TCP_RESET acl
#
#	This can be used to return a ERR_ page for requests which
#	do not pass the 'http_access' rules.  Squid remembers the last
#	acl it evaluated in http_access, and if a 'deny_info' line exists
#	for that ACL Squid returns a corresponding error page.
#
#	The acl is typically the last acl on the http_access deny line which
#	denied access. The exceptions to this rule are:
#	- When Squid needs to request authentication credentials. It's then
#	  the first authentication related acl encountered
#	- When none of the http_access lines matches. It's then the last
#	  acl processed on the last http_access line.
#	- When the decision to deny access was made by an adaptation service,
#	  the acl name is the corresponding eCAP or ICAP service_name.
#
#	NP: If providing your own custom error pages with error_directory
#	    you may also specify them by your custom file name:
#	    Example: deny_info ERR_CUSTOM_ACCESS_DENIED bad_guys
#
#	By defaut Squid will send "403 Forbidden". A different 4xx or 5xx
#	may be specified by prefixing the file name with the code and a colon.
#	e.g. 404:ERR_CUSTOM_ACCESS_DENIED
#
#	Alternatively you can tell Squid to reset the TCP connection
#	by specifying TCP_RESET.
#
#	Or you can specify an error URL or URL pattern. The browsers will
#	get redirected to the specified URL after formatting tags have
#	been replaced. Redirect will be done with 302 or 307 according to
#	HTTP/1.1 specs. A different 3xx code may be specified by prefixing
#	the URL. e.g. 303:http://example.com/
#
#	URL FORMAT TAGS:
#		%a	- username (if available. Password NOT included)
#		%B	- FTP path URL
#		%e	- Error number
#		%E	- Error description
#		%h	- Squid hostname
#		%H	- Request domain name
#		%i	- Client IP Address
#		%M	- Request Method
#		%o	- Message result from external ACL helper
#		%p	- Request Port number
#		%P	- Request Protocol name
#		%R	- Request URL path
#		%T	- Timestamp in RFC 1123 format
#		%U	- Full canonical URL from client
#			  (HTTPS URLs terminate with *)
#		%u	- Full canonical URL from client
#		%w	- Admin email from squid.conf
#		%x	- Error name
#		%%	- Literal percent (%) code
#
#Default:
# none

# OPTIONS INFLUENCING REQUEST FORWARDING 
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

#  TAG: nonhierarchical_direct
#	By default, Squid will send any non-hierarchical requests
#	(not cacheable request type) direct to origin servers.
#
#	When this is set to "off", Squid will prefer to send these
#	requests to parents.
#
#	Note that in most configurations, by turning this off you will only
#	add latency to these request without any improvement in global hit
#	ratio.
#
#	This option only sets a preference. If the parent is unavailable a
#	direct connection to the origin server may still be attempted. To
#	completely prevent direct connections use never_direct.
#Default:
# nonhierarchical_direct on

#  TAG: prefer_direct
#	Normally Squid tries to use parents for most requests. If you for some
#	reason like it to first try going direct and only use a parent if
#	going direct fails set this to on.
#
#	By combining nonhierarchical_direct off and prefer_direct on you
#	can set up Squid to use a parent as a backup path if going direct
#	fails.
#
#	Note: If you want Squid to use parents for all requests see
#	the never_direct directive. prefer_direct only modifies how Squid
#	acts on cacheable requests.
#Default:
# prefer_direct off

#  TAG: cache_miss_revalidate	on|off
#	RFC 7232 defines a conditional request mechanism to prevent
#	response objects being unnecessarily transferred over the network.
#	If that mechanism is used by the client and a cache MISS occurs
#	it can prevent new cache entries being created.
#
#	This option determines whether Squid on cache MISS will pass the
#	client revalidation request to the server or tries to fetch new
#	content for caching. It can be useful while the cache is mostly
#	empty to more quickly have the cache populated by generating
#	non-conditional GETs.
#
#	When set to 'on' (default), Squid will pass all client If-* headers
#	to the server. This permits server responses without a cacheable
#	payload to be delivered and on MISS no new cache entry is created.
#
#	When set to 'off' and if the request is cacheable, Squid will
#	remove the clients If-Modified-Since and If-None-Match headers from
#	the request sent to the server. This requests a 200 status response
#	from the server to create a new cache entry with.
#Default:
# cache_miss_revalidate on

#  TAG: always_direct
#	Usage: always_direct allow|deny [!]aclname ...
#
#	Here you can use ACL elements to specify requests which should
#	ALWAYS be forwarded by Squid to the origin servers without using
#	any peers.  For example, to always directly forward requests for
#	local servers ignoring any parents or siblings you may have use
#	something like:
#
#		acl local-servers dstdomain my.domain.net
#		always_direct allow local-servers
#
#	To always forward FTP requests directly, use
#
#		acl FTP proto FTP
#		always_direct allow FTP
#
#	NOTE: There is a similar, but opposite option named
#	'never_direct'.  You need to be aware that "always_direct deny
#	foo" is NOT the same thing as "never_direct allow foo".  You
#	may need to use a deny rule to exclude a more-specific case of
#	some other rule.  Example:
#
#		acl local-external dstdomain external.foo.net
#		acl local-servers dstdomain  .foo.net
#		always_direct deny local-external
#		always_direct allow local-servers
#
#	NOTE: If your goal is to make the client forward the request
#	directly to the origin server bypassing Squid then this needs
#	to be done in the client configuration. Squid configuration
#	can only tell Squid how Squid should fetch the object.
#
#	NOTE: This directive is not related to caching. The replies
#	is cached as usual even if you use always_direct. To not cache
#	the replies see the 'cache' directive.
#
#	This clause supports both fast and slow acl types.
#	See http://wiki.squid-cache.org/SquidFaq/SquidAcl for details.
#Default:
# Prevent any cache_peer being used for this request.

#  TAG: never_direct
#	Usage: never_direct allow|deny [!]aclname ...
#
#	never_direct is the opposite of always_direct.  Please read
#	the description for always_direct if you have not already.
#
#	With 'never_direct' you can use ACL elements to specify
#	requests which should NEVER be forwarded directly to origin
#	servers.  For example, to force the use of a proxy for all
#	requests, except those in your local domain use something like:
#
#		acl local-servers dstdomain .foo.net
#		never_direct deny local-servers
#		never_direct allow all
#
#	or if Squid is inside a firewall and there are local intranet
#	servers inside the firewall use something like:
#
#		acl local-intranet dstdomain .foo.net
#		acl local-external dstdomain external.foo.net
#		always_direct deny local-external
#		always_direct allow local-intranet
#		never_direct allow all
#
#	This clause supports both fast and slow acl types.
#	See http://wiki.squid-cache.org/SquidFaq/SquidAcl for details.
#Default:
# Allow DNS results to be used for this request.

#  TAG: accept_filter
#	FreeBSD:
#
#	The name of an accept(2) filter to install on Squid's
#	listen socket(s).  This feature is perhaps specific to
#	FreeBSD and requires support in the kernel.
#
#	The 'httpready' filter delays delivering new connections
#	to Squid until a full HTTP request has been received.
#	See the accf_http(9) man page for details.
#
#	The 'dataready' filter delays delivering new connections
#	to Squid until there is some data to process.
#	See the accf_dataready(9) man page for details.
#
#	Linux:
#	
#	The 'data' filter delays delivering of new connections
#	to Squid until there is some data to process by TCP_ACCEPT_DEFER.
#	You may optionally specify a number of seconds to wait by
#	'data=N' where N is the number of seconds. Defaults to 30
#	if not specified.  See the tcp(7) man page for details.
#EXAMPLE:
## FreeBSD
#accept_filter httpready
## Linux
#accept_filter data
#Default:
# none

#  TAG: client_ip_max_connections
#	Set an absolute limit on the number of connections a single
#	client IP can use. Any more than this and Squid will begin to drop
#	new connections from the client until it closes some links.
#
#	Note that this is a global limit. It affects all HTTP, HTCP, Gopher and FTP
#	connections from the client. For finer control use the ACL access controls.
#
#	Requires client_db to be enabled (the default).
#
#	WARNING: This may noticably slow down traffic received via external proxies
#	or NAT devices and cause them to rebound error messages back to their clients.
#Default:
# No limit.

#  TAG: tcp_recv_bufsize	(bytes)
#	Size of receive buffer to set for TCP sockets.  Probably just
#	as easy to change your kernel's default.
#	Omit from squid.conf to use the default buffer size.
#Default:
# Use operating system TCP defaults.

# ICAP OPTIONS
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

#  TAG: icap_enable	on|off
#	If you want to enable the ICAP module support, set this to on.
#Default:
# icap_enable off

#  TAG: icap_connect_timeout
#	This parameter specifies how long to wait for the TCP connect to
#	the requested ICAP server to complete before giving up and either
#	terminating the HTTP transaction or bypassing the failure.
#
#	The default for optional services is peer_connect_timeout.
#	The default for essential services is connect_timeout.
#	If this option is explicitly set, its value applies to all services.
#Default:
# none

#  TAG: icap_io_timeout	time-units
#	This parameter specifies how long to wait for an I/O activity on
#	an established, active ICAP connection before giving up and
#	either terminating the HTTP transaction or bypassing the
#	failure.
#Default:
# Use read_timeout.

#  TAG: icap_service_failure_limit	limit [in memory-depth time-units]
#	The limit specifies the number of failures that Squid tolerates
#	when establishing a new TCP connection with an ICAP service. If
#	the number of failures exceeds the limit, the ICAP service is
#	not used for new ICAP requests until it is time to refresh its
#	OPTIONS.
#
#	A negative value disables the limit. Without the limit, an ICAP
#	service will not be considered down due to connectivity failures
#	between ICAP OPTIONS requests.
#
#	Squid forgets ICAP service failures older than the specified
#	value of memory-depth. The memory fading algorithm 
#	is approximate because Squid does not remember individual 
#	errors but groups them instead, splitting the option
#	value into ten time slots of equal length.
#
#	When memory-depth is 0 and by default this option has no 
#	effect on service failure expiration.
#
#	Squid always forgets failures when updating service settings
#	using an ICAP OPTIONS transaction, regardless of this option
#	setting.
#
#	For example,
#		# suspend service usage after 10 failures in 5 seconds:
#		icap_service_failure_limit 10 in 5 seconds
#Default:
# icap_service_failure_limit 10

#  TAG: icap_service_revival_delay
#	The delay specifies the number of seconds to wait after an ICAP
#	OPTIONS request failure before requesting the options again. The
#	failed ICAP service is considered "down" until fresh OPTIONS are
#	fetched.
#
#	The actual delay cannot be smaller than the hardcoded minimum
#	delay of 30 seconds.
#Default:
# icap_service_revival_delay 180

#  TAG: icap_preview_enable	on|off
#	The ICAP Preview feature allows the ICAP server to handle the
#	HTTP message by looking only at the beginning of the message body
#	or even without receiving the body at all. In some environments, 
#	previews greatly speedup ICAP processing.
#
#	During an ICAP OPTIONS transaction, the server may tell	Squid what
#	HTTP messages should be previewed and how big the preview should be.
#	Squid will not use Preview if the server did not request one.
#
#	To disable ICAP Preview for all ICAP services, regardless of
#	individual ICAP server OPTIONS responses, set this option to "off".
#Example:
#icap_preview_enable off
#Default:
# icap_preview_enable on

#  TAG: icap_preview_size
#	The default size of preview data to be sent to the ICAP server.
#	This value might be overwritten on a per server basis by OPTIONS requests.
#Default:
# No preview sent.

#  TAG: icap_206_enable	on|off
#	206 (Partial Content) responses is an ICAP extension that allows the
#	ICAP agents to optionally combine adapted and original HTTP message
#	content. The decision to combine is postponed until the end of the
#	ICAP response. Squid supports Partial Content extension by default.
#
#	Activation of the Partial Content extension is negotiated with each
#	ICAP service during OPTIONS exchange. Most ICAP servers should handle
#	negotation correctly even if they do not support the extension, but
#	some might fail. To disable Partial Content support for all ICAP
#	services and to avoid any negotiation, set this option to "off".
#
#	Example:
#	    icap_206_enable off
#Default:
# icap_206_enable on

#  TAG: icap_default_options_ttl
#	The default TTL value for ICAP OPTIONS responses that don't have
#	an Options-TTL header.
#Default:
# icap_default_options_ttl 60

#  TAG: icap_persistent_connections	on|off
#	Whether or not Squid should use persistent connections to
#	an ICAP server.
#Default:
# icap_persistent_connections on

#  TAG: adaptation_send_client_ip	on|off
#	If enabled, Squid shares HTTP client IP information with adaptation
#	services. For ICAP, Squid adds the X-Client-IP header to ICAP requests.
#	For eCAP, Squid sets the libecap::metaClientIp transaction option.
#
#	See also: adaptation_uses_indirect_client
#Default:
# adaptation_send_client_ip off

#  TAG: adaptation_send_username	on|off
#	This sends authenticated HTTP client username (if available) to
#	the adaptation service.
#
#	For ICAP, the username value is encoded based on the
#	icap_client_username_encode option and is sent using the header
#	specified by the icap_client_username_header option.
#Default:
# adaptation_send_username off

#  TAG: icap_client_username_header
#	ICAP request header name to use for adaptation_send_username.
#Default:
# icap_client_username_header X-Client-Username

#  TAG: icap_client_username_encode	on|off
#	Whether to base64 encode the authenticated client username.
#Default:
# icap_client_username_encode off

#  TAG: icap_service
#	Defines a single ICAP service using the following format:
#
#	icap_service id vectoring_point uri [option ...]
#
#	id: ID
#		an opaque identifier or name which is used to direct traffic to
#		this specific service. Must be unique among all adaptation
#		services in squid.conf.
#
#	vectoring_point: reqmod_precache|reqmod_postcache|respmod_precache|respmod_postcache
#		This specifies at which point of transaction processing the
#		ICAP service should be activated. *_postcache vectoring points
#		are not yet supported.
#
#	uri: icap://servername:port/servicepath
#		ICAP server and service location.
#
#	ICAP does not allow a single service to handle both REQMOD and RESPMOD
#	transactions. Squid does not enforce that requirement. You can specify
#	services with the same service_url and different vectoring_points. You
#	can even specify multiple identical services as long as their
#	service_names differ.
#
#	To activate a service, use the adaptation_access directive. To group
#	services, use adaptation_service_chain and adaptation_service_set.
#
#	Service options are separated by white space. ICAP services support
#	the following name=value options:
#
#	bypass=on|off|1|0
#		If set to 'on' or '1', the ICAP service is treated as
#		optional. If the service cannot be reached or malfunctions,
#		Squid will try to ignore any errors and process the message as
#		if the service was not enabled. No all ICAP errors can be
#		bypassed.  If set to 0, the ICAP service is treated as
#		essential and all ICAP errors will result in an error page
#		returned to the HTTP client.
#
#		Bypass is off by default: services are treated as essential.
#
#	routing=on|off|1|0
#		If set to 'on' or '1', the ICAP service is allowed to
#		dynamically change the current message adaptation plan by
#		returning a chain of services to be used next. The services
#		are specified using the X-Next-Services ICAP response header
#		value, formatted as a comma-separated list of service names.
#		Each named service should be configured in squid.conf. Other
#		services are ignored. An empty X-Next-Services value results
#		in an empty plan which ends the current adaptation.
#
#		Dynamic adaptation plan may cross or cover multiple supported
#		vectoring points in their natural processing order.
#
#		Routing is not allowed by default: the ICAP X-Next-Services
#		response header is ignored.
#
#	ipv6=on|off
#		Only has effect on split-stack systems. The default on those systems
#		is to use IPv4-only connections. When set to 'on' this option will
#		make Squid use IPv6-only connections to contact this ICAP service.
#
#	on-overload=block|bypass|wait|force
#		If the service Max-Connections limit has been reached, do
#		one of the following for each new ICAP transaction:
#		  * block:  send an HTTP error response to the client
#		  * bypass: ignore the "over-connected" ICAP service
#		  * wait:   wait (in a FIFO queue) for an ICAP connection slot
#		  * force:  proceed, ignoring the Max-Connections limit 
#
#		In SMP mode with N workers, each worker assumes the service
#		connection limit is Max-Connections/N, even though not all
#		workers may use a given service.
#
#		The default value is "bypass" if service is bypassable,
#		otherwise it is set to "wait".
#		
#
#	max-conn=number
#		Use the given number as the Max-Connections limit, regardless
#		of the Max-Connections value given by the service, if any.
#
#	Older icap_service format without optional named parameters is
#	deprecated but supported for backward compatibility.
#
#Example:
#icap_service svcBlocker reqmod_precache icap://icap1.mydomain.net:1344/reqmod bypass=0
#icap_service svcLogger reqmod_precache icap://icap2.mydomain.net:1344/respmod routing=on
#Default:
# none

#  TAG: icap_class
#	This deprecated option was documented to define an ICAP service
#	chain, even though it actually defined a set of similar, redundant
#	services, and the chains were not supported. 
#
#	To define a set of redundant services, please use the
#	adaptation_service_set directive. For service chains, use
#	adaptation_service_chain.
#Default:
# none

#  TAG: icap_access
#	This option is deprecated. Please use adaptation_access, which
#	has the same ICAP functionality, but comes with better
#	documentation, and eCAP support.
#Default:
# none

# eCAP OPTIONS
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

#  TAG: ecap_enable	on|off
#	Controls whether eCAP support is enabled.
#Default:
# ecap_enable off

#  TAG: ecap_service
#	Defines a single eCAP service
#
#	ecap_service id vectoring_point uri [option ...]
#
#        id: ID
#		an opaque identifier or name which is used to direct traffic to
#		this specific service. Must be unique among all adaptation
#		services in squid.conf.
#
#	vectoring_point: reqmod_precache|reqmod_postcache|respmod_precache|respmod_postcache
#		This specifies at which point of transaction processing the
#		eCAP service should be activated. *_postcache vectoring points
#		are not yet supported.
#
#	uri: ecap://vendor/service_name?custom&cgi=style&parameters=optional
#		Squid uses the eCAP service URI to match this configuration
#		line with one of the dynamically loaded services. Each loaded
#		eCAP service must have a unique URI. Obtain the right URI from
#		the service provider.
#
#	To activate a service, use the adaptation_access directive. To group
#	services, use adaptation_service_chain and adaptation_service_set.
#
#	Service options are separated by white space. eCAP services support
#	the following name=value options:
#
#	bypass=on|off|1|0
#		If set to 'on' or '1', the eCAP service is treated as optional.
#		If the service cannot be reached or malfunctions, Squid will try
#		to ignore any errors and process the message as if the service
#		was not enabled. No all eCAP errors can be bypassed.

#
#                Bypass is off by default: services are treated as essential.
#
#	routing=on|off|1|0
#		If set to 'on' or '1', the eCAP service is allowed to
#		dynamically change the current message adaptation plan by
#		returning a chain of services to be used next.
#
#		Dynamic adaptation plan may cross or cover multiple supported
#		vectoring points in their natural processing order.

#		Routing is not allowed by default.
#
#	Older ecap_service format without optional named parameters is

#
#
#Example:

#ecap_service s2 respmod_precache ecap://filters.R.us/virusFilter config=/etc/vf.cfg bypass=on
#Default:
# none

#  TAG: loadable_modules
#	Instructs Squid to load the specified dynamic module(s) or activate
#	preloaded module(s).
#Example:
#loadable_modules /usr/lib/MinimalAdapter.so
#Default:
# none

# MESSAGE ADAPTATION OPTIONS
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

#  TAG: adaptation_service_set
#
#	Configures an ordered set of similar, redundant services. This is
#	useful when hot standby or backup adaptation servers are available.
#
#	    adaptation_service_set set_name service_name1 service_name2 ...
#
# 	The named services are used in the set declaration order. The first
#	applicable adaptation service from the set is used first. The next
#	applicable service is tried if and only if the transaction with the
#	previous service fails and the message waiting to be adapted is still
#	intact.
#
#	When adaptation starts, broken services are ignored as if they were
#	not a part of the set. A broken service is a down optional service.
#
#	The services in a set must be attached to the same vectoring point
#	(e.g., pre-cache) and use the same adaptation method (e.g., REQMOD).
#
#	If all services in a set are optional then adaptation failures are
#	bypassable. If all services in the set are essential, then a
#	transaction failure with one service may still be retried using
#	another service from the set, but when all services fail, the master
#	transaction fails as well.
#
#	A set may contain a mix of optional and essential services, but that
#	is likely to lead to surprising results because broken services become
#	ignored (see above), making previously bypassable failures fatal.
#	Technically, it is the bypassability of the last failed service that
#	matters.
#
#	See also: adaptation_access adaptation_service_chain
#
#Example:
#adaptation_service_set svcBlocker urlFilterPrimary urlFilterBackup
#adaptation service_set svcLogger loggerLocal loggerRemote
#Default:
# none

#  TAG: adaptation_service_chain
#
#	Configures a list of complementary services that will be applied
#	one-by-one, forming an adaptation chain or pipeline. This is useful
#	when Squid must perform different adaptations on the same message.
#
#	    adaptation_service_chain chain_name service_name1 svc_name2 ...
#
# 	The named services are used in the chain declaration order. The first
#	applicable adaptation service from the chain is used first. The next
#	applicable service is applied to the successful adaptation results of
#	the previous service in the chain.
#
#	When adaptation starts, broken services are ignored as if they were
#	not a part of the chain. A broken service is a down optional service.
#
#	Request satisfaction terminates the adaptation chain because Squid
#	does not currently allow declaration of RESPMOD services at the
#	"reqmod_precache" vectoring point (see icap_service or ecap_service).
#
#	The services in a chain must be attached to the same vectoring point
#	(e.g., pre-cache) and use the same adaptation method (e.g., REQMOD).
#
#	A chain may contain a mix of optional and essential services. If an
#	essential adaptation fails (or the failure cannot be bypassed for
#	other reasons), the master transaction fails. Otherwise, the failure
#	is bypassed as if the failed adaptation service was not in the chain.
#
#	See also: adaptation_access adaptation_service_set
#
#Example:
#adaptation_service_chain svcRequest requestLogger urlFilter leakDetector
#Default:
# none

#  TAG: adaptation_access
#	Sends an HTTP transaction to an ICAP or eCAP adaptation	service.
#
#	adaptation_access service_name allow|deny [!]aclname...
#	adaptation_access set_name     allow|deny [!]aclname...
#
#	At each supported vectoring point, the adaptation_access
#	statements are processed in the order they appear in this
#	configuration file. Statements pointing to the following services
#	are ignored (i.e., skipped without checking their ACL):
#
#	    - services serving different vectoring points
#	    - "broken-but-bypassable" services
#	    - "up" services configured to ignore such transactions
#              (e.g., based on the ICAP Transfer-Ignore header).
#
#        When a set_name is used, all services in the set are checked
#	using the same rules, to find the first applicable one. See
#	adaptation_service_set for details.
#
#	If an access list is checked and there is a match, the
#	processing stops: For an "allow" rule, the corresponding
#	adaptation service is used for the transaction. For a "deny"
#	rule, no adaptation service is activated.
#
#	It is currently not possible to apply more than one adaptation
#	service at the same vectoring point to the same HTTP transaction.
#
#        See also: icap_service and ecap_service
#
#Example:
#adaptation_access service_1 allow all
#Default:
# Allow, unless rules exist in squid.conf.

#  TAG: adaptation_service_iteration_limit
#	Limits the number of iterations allowed when applying adaptation
#	services to a message. If your longest adaptation set or chain
#	may have more than 16 services, increase the limit beyond its
#	default value of 16. If detecting infinite iteration loops sooner
#	is critical, make the iteration limit match the actual number
#	of services in your longest adaptation set or chain.
#
#	Infinite adaptation loops are most likely with routing services.
#
#	See also: icap_service routing=1
#Default:
# adaptation_service_iteration_limit 16

#  TAG: adaptation_masterx_shared_names
#	For each master transaction (i.e., the HTTP request and response
#	sequence, including all related ICAP and eCAP exchanges), Squid
#	maintains a table of metadata. The table entries are (name, value)
#	pairs shared among eCAP and ICAP exchanges. The table is destroyed
#	with the master transaction.
#
#	This option specifies the table entry names that Squid must accept
#	from and forward to the adaptation transactions.
#
#	An ICAP REQMOD or RESPMOD transaction may set an entry in the 
#	shared table by returning an ICAP header field with a name 
#	specified in adaptation_masterx_shared_names.
#
#	An eCAP REQMOD or RESPMOD transaction may set an entry in the
#	shared table by implementing the libecap::visitEachOption() API
#	to provide an option with a name specified in
#	adaptation_masterx_shared_names.
#
#	Squid will store and forward the set entry to subsequent adaptation
#	transactions within the same master transaction scope.
#
#	Only one shared entry name is supported at this time.
#
#Example:
## share authentication information among ICAP services
#adaptation_masterx_shared_names X-Subscriber-ID
#Default:
# none

#  TAG: adaptation_meta
#	This option allows Squid administrator to add custom ICAP request
#	headers or eCAP options to Squid ICAP requests or eCAP transactions.
#	Use it to pass custom authentication tokens and other
#	transaction-state related meta information to an ICAP/eCAP service.
#	
#	The addition of a meta header is ACL-driven:
#		adaptation_meta name value [!]aclname ...
#	
#	Processing for a given header name stops after the first ACL list match.
#	Thus, it is impossible to add two headers with the same name. If no ACL
#	lists match for a given header name, no such header is added. For 
#	example:
#	
#		# do not debug transactions except for those that need debugging
#		adaptation_meta X-Debug 1 needs_debugging
#	
#		# log all transactions except for those that must remain secret
#		adaptation_meta X-Log 1 !keep_secret
#	
#		# mark transactions from users in the "G 1" group
#		adaptation_meta X-Authenticated-Groups "G 1" authed_as_G1
#	
#	The "value" parameter may be a regular squid.conf token or a "double
#	quoted string". Within the quoted string, use backslash (\) to escape
#	any character, which is currently only useful for escaping backslashes
#	and double quotes. For example,
#	    "this string has one backslash (\\) and two \"quotes\""
#
#	Used adaptation_meta header values may be logged via %note
#	logformat code. If multiple adaptation_meta headers with the same name
#	are used during master transaction lifetime, the header values are
#	logged in the order they were used and duplicate values are ignored
#	(only the first repeated value will be logged).
#Default:
# none

#  TAG: icap_retry
#	This ACL determines which retriable ICAP transactions are
#	retried. Transactions that received a complete ICAP response
#	and did not have to consume or produce HTTP bodies to receive
#	that response are usually retriable.
#
#	icap_retry allow|deny [!]aclname ...
#
#	Squid automatically retries some ICAP I/O timeouts and errors
#	due to persistent connection race conditions.
#
#	See also: icap_retry_limit
#Default:
# icap_retry deny all

#  TAG: icap_retry_limit
#	Limits the number of retries allowed.
#
#	Communication errors due to persistent connection race
#	conditions are unavoidable, automatically retried, and do not
#	count against this limit.
#
#	See also: icap_retry
#Default:
# No retries are allowed.

# DNS OPTIONS
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

#  TAG: check_hostnames
#	For security and stability reasons Squid can check
#	hostnames for Internet standard RFC compliance. If you want
#	Squid to perform these checks turn this directive on.
#Default:
# check_hostnames off

#  TAG: allow_underscore
#	Underscore characters is not strictly allowed in Internet hostnames
#	but nevertheless used by many sites. Set this to off if you want
#	Squid to be strict about the standard.
#	This check is performed only when check_hostnames is set to on.
#Default:
# allow_underscore on

#  TAG: dns_retransmit_interval
#	Initial retransmit interval for DNS queries. The interval is
#	doubled each time all configured DNS servers have been tried.
#Default:
# dns_retransmit_interval 5 seconds

#  TAG: dns_timeout
#	DNS Query timeout. If no response is received to a DNS query
#	within this time all DNS servers for the queried domain
#	are assumed to be unavailable.
#Default:
# dns_timeout 30 seconds

#  TAG: dns_packet_max
#	Maximum number of bytes packet size to advertise via EDNS.
#	Set to "none" to disable EDNS large packet support.
#	
#	For legacy reasons DNS UDP replies will default to 512 bytes which
#	is too small for many responses. EDNS provides a means for Squid to
#	negotiate receiving larger responses back immediately without having
#	to failover with repeat requests. Responses larger than this limit
#	will retain the old behaviour of failover to TCP DNS.
#	
#	Squid has no real fixed limit internally, but allowing packet sizes
#	over 1500 bytes requires network jumbogram support and is usually not
#	necessary.
#	
#	WARNING: The RFC also indicates that some older resolvers will reply
#	with failure of the whole request if the extension is added. Some
#	resolvers have already been identified which will reply with mangled
#	EDNS response on occasion. Usually in response to many-KB jumbogram
#	sizes being advertised by Squid.
#	Squid will currently treat these both as an unable-to-resolve domain
#	even if it would be resolvable without EDNS.
#Default:
# EDNS disabled

#  TAG: dns_defnames	on|off
#	Normally the RES_DEFNAMES resolver option is disabled
#	(see res_init(3)).  This prevents caches in a hierarchy
#	from interpreting single-component hostnames locally.  To allow
#	Squid to handle single-component names, enable this option.
#Default:
# Search for single-label domain names is disabled.

#  TAG: dns_multicast_local	on|off
#	When set to on, Squid sends multicast DNS lookups on the local
#	network for domains ending in .local and .arpa.
#	This enables local servers and devices to be contacted in an
#	ad-hoc or zero-configuration network environment.
#Default:
# Search for .local and .arpa names is disabled.

#  TAG: dns_nameservers
#	Use this if you want to specify a list of DNS name servers
#	(IP addresses) to use instead of those given in your
#	/etc/resolv.conf file.
#
#	On Windows platforms, if no value is specified here or in
#	the /etc/resolv.conf file, the list of DNS name servers are
#	taken from the Windows registry, both static and dynamic DHCP
#	configurations are supported.
#
#	Example: dns_nameservers 10.0.0.1 192.172.0.4
#Default:
# Use operating system definitions

#  TAG: hosts_file
#	Location of the host-local IP name-address associations
#	database. Most Operating Systems have such a file on different
#	default locations:
#	- Un*X & Linux:    /etc/hosts
#	- Windows NT/2000: %SystemRoot%\system32\drivers\etc\hosts
#			   (%SystemRoot% value install default is c:\winnt)
#	- Windows XP/2003: %SystemRoot%\system32\drivers\etc\hosts
#			   (%SystemRoot% value install default is c:\windows)
#	- Windows 9x/Me:   %windir%\hosts
#			   (%windir% value is usually c:\windows)
#	- Cygwin:	   /etc/hosts
#
#	The file contains newline-separated definitions, in the
#	form ip_address_in_dotted_form name [name ...] names are
#	whitespace-separated. Lines beginning with an hash (#)
#	character are comments.
#
#	The file is checked at startup and upon configuration.
#	If set to 'none', it won't be checked.
#	If append_domain is used, that domain will be added to
#	domain-local (i.e. not containing any dot character) host
#	definitions.
#Default:
# hosts_file /etc/hosts

#  TAG: append_domain
#	Appends local domain name to hostnames without any dots in
#	them.  append_domain must begin with a period.
#
#	Be warned there are now Internet names with no dots in
#	them using only top-domain names, so setting this may
#	cause some Internet sites to become unavailable.
#
#Example:
# append_domain .yourdomain.com
#Default:
# Use operating system definitions

#  TAG: ignore_unknown_nameservers
#	By default Squid checks that DNS responses are received
#	from the same IP addresses they are sent to.  If they
#	don't match, Squid ignores the response and writes a warning
#	message to cache.log.  You can allow responses from unknown
#	nameservers by setting this option to 'off'.
#Default:
# ignore_unknown_nameservers on

#  TAG: dns_v4_first
#	With the IPv6 Internet being as fast or faster than IPv4 Internet
#	for most networks Squid prefers to contact websites over IPv6.
#
#	This option reverses the order of preference to make Squid contact
#	dual-stack websites over IPv4 first. Squid will still perform both
#	IPv6 and IPv4 DNS lookups before connecting.
#
#	WARNING:
#	  This option will restrict the situations under which IPv6
#	  connectivity is used (and tested), potentially hiding network
#	  problems which would otherwise be detected and warned about.
#Default:
# dns_v4_first off

#  TAG: ipcache_size	(number of entries)
#	Maximum number of DNS IP cache entries.
#Default:
# ipcache_size 1024

#  TAG: ipcache_low	(percent)
#Default:
# ipcache_low 90

#  TAG: ipcache_high	(percent)
#	The size, low-, and high-water marks for the IP cache.
#Default:
# ipcache_high 95

#  TAG: fqdncache_size	(number of entries)
#	Maximum number of FQDN cache entries.
#Default:
# fqdncache_size 1024

# MISCELLANEOUS
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

#  TAG: configuration_includes_quoted_values	on|off
#	If set, Squid will recognize each "quoted string" after a configuration
#	directive as a single parameter. The quotes are stripped before the
#	parameter value is interpreted or used.
#	See "Values with spaces, quotes, and other special characters"
#	section for more details.
#Default:
# configuration_includes_quoted_values off

#  TAG: memory_pools	on|off
#	If set, Squid will keep pools of allocated (but unused) memory
#	available for future use.  If memory is a premium on your
#	system and you believe your malloc library outperforms Squid
#	routines, disable this.
#Default:
# memory_pools on

#  TAG: memory_pools_limit	(bytes)
#	Used only with memory_pools on:
#	memory_pools_limit 50 MB
#
#	If set to a non-zero value, Squid will keep at most the specified
#	limit of allocated (but unused) memory in memory pools. All free()
#	requests that exceed this limit will be handled by your malloc
#	library. Squid does not pre-allocate any memory, just safe-keeps
#	objects that otherwise would be free()d. Thus, it is safe to set
#	memory_pools_limit to a reasonably high value even if your
#	configuration will use less memory.
#
#	If set to none, Squid will keep all memory it can. That is, there
#	will be no limit on the total amount of memory used for safe-keeping.
#
#	To disable memory allocation optimization, do not set
#	memory_pools_limit to 0 or none. Set memory_pools to "off" instead.
#
#	An overhead for maintaining memory pools is not taken into account
#	when the limit is checked. This overhead is close to four bytes per
#	object kept. However, pools may actually _save_ memory because of
#	reduced memory thrashing in your malloc library.
#Default:
# memory_pools_limit 5 MB

#  TAG: forwarded_for	on|off|transparent|truncate|delete
#	If set to "on", Squid will append your client's IP address
#	in the HTTP requests it forwards. By default it looks like:
#
#		X-Forwarded-For: 192.1.2.3
#
#	If set to "off", it will appear as
#
#		X-Forwarded-For: unknown
#
#	If set to "transparent", Squid will not alter the
#	X-Forwarded-For header in any way.
#
#	If set to "delete", Squid will delete the entire
#	X-Forwarded-For header.
#
#	If set to "truncate", Squid will remove all existing
#	X-Forwarded-For entries, and place the client IP as the sole entry.
#Default:

# (c.michaud): do not introduce a X-Forwarded-For so that nginx will take squid has the client originating the request
# in order to simulate a client on a different network.
forwarded_for on

#  TAG: cachemgr_passwd
#	Specify passwords for cachemgr operations.
#
#	Usage: cachemgr_passwd password action action ...
#
#	Some valid actions are (see cache manager menu for a full list):
#		5min
#		60min
#		asndb
#		authenticator
#		cbdata
#		client_list
#		comm_incoming
#		config *
#		counters
#		delay
#		digest_stats

#		reconfigure *
#		redirector
#		refresh
#		server_list
#		shutdown *
#		store_digest
#		storedir
#		utilization
#		via_headers
#		vm_objects
#
#	* Indicates actions which will not be performed without a
#	  valid password, others can be performed if not listed here.
#
#	To disable an action, set the password to "disable".
#	To allow performing an action without a password, set the
#	password to "none".
#
#	Use the keyword "all" to set the same password for all actions.
#
#Example:
# cachemgr_passwd secret shutdown
# cachemgr_passwd lesssssssecret info stats/objects
# cachemgr_passwd disable all
#Default:
# No password. Actions which require password are denied.

#  TAG: client_db	on|off
#	If you want to disable collecting per-client statistics,
#	turn off client_db here.
#Default:
# client_db on

#  TAG: refresh_all_ims	on|off
#	When you enable this option, squid will always check
#	the origin server for an update when a client sends an
#	If-Modified-Since request.  Many browsers use IMS
#	requests when the user requests a reload, and this
#	ensures those clients receive the latest version.
#
#	By default (off), squid may return a Not Modified response
#	based on the age of the cached version.
#Default:
# refresh_all_ims off

#  TAG: reload_into_ims	on|off
#	When you enable this option, client no-cache or ``reload''
#	requests will be changed to If-Modified-Since requests.
#	Doing this VIOLATES the HTTP standard.  Enabling this
#	feature could make you liable for problems which it
#	causes.
#
#	see also refresh_pattern for a more selective approach.
#Default:
# reload_into_ims off

#  TAG: connect_retries
#	This sets the maximum number of connection attempts made for each
#	TCP connection. The connect_retries attempts must all still
#	complete within the connection timeout period.
#
#	The default is not to re-try if the first connection attempt fails.
#	The (not recommended) maximum is 10 tries.
#
#	A warning message will be generated if it is set to a too-high
#	value and the configured value will be over-ridden.
#
#	Note: These re-tries are in addition to forward_max_tries
#	which limit how many different addresses may be tried to find
#	a useful server.
#Default:
# Do not retry failed connections.

#  TAG: retry_on_error
#	If set to ON Squid will automatically retry requests when
#	receiving an error response with status 403 (Forbidden),
#	500 (Internal Error), 501 or 503 (Service not available).
#	Status 502 and 504 (Gateway errors) are always retried.
#	
#	This is mainly useful if you are in a complex cache hierarchy to
#	work around access control errors.
#	
#	NOTE: This retry will attempt to find another working destination.
#	Which is different from the server which just failed.
#Default:
# retry_on_error off

#  TAG: as_whois_server
#	WHOIS server to query for AS numbers.  NOTE: AS numbers are
#	queried only when Squid starts up, not for every request.
#Default:
# as_whois_server whois.ra.net

#  TAG: offline_mode
#	Enable this option and Squid will never try to validate cached
#	objects.
#Default:
# offline_mode off

#  TAG: uri_whitespace
#	What to do with requests that have whitespace characters in the
#	URI.  Options:
#
#	strip:  The whitespace characters are stripped out of the URL.
#		This is the behavior recommended by RFC2396 and RFC3986
#		for tolerant handling of generic URI.
#		NOTE: This is one difference between generic URI and HTTP URLs.
#
#	deny:   The request is denied.  The user receives an "Invalid
#		Request" message.
#		This is the behaviour recommended by RFC2616 for safe
#		handling of HTTP request URL.
#
#	allow:  The request is allowed and the URI is not changed.  The
#		whitespace characters remain in the URI.  Note the
#		whitespace is passed to redirector processes if they
#		are in use.
#		Note this may be considered a violation of RFC2616
#		request parsing where whitespace is prohibited in the
#		URL field.
#
#	encode:	The request is allowed and the whitespace characters are
#		encoded according to RFC1738.
#
#	chop:	The request is allowed and the URI is chopped at the
#		first whitespace.
#
#
#	NOTE the current Squid implementation of encode and chop violates
#	RFC2616 by not using a 301 redirect after altering the URL.
#Default:
# uri_whitespace strip

#  TAG: chroot
#	Specifies a directory where Squid should do a chroot() while
#	initializing.  This also causes Squid to fully drop root
#	privileges after initializing.  This means, for example, if you
#	use a HTTP port less than 1024 and try to reconfigure, you may
#	get an error saying that Squid can not open the port.
#Default:
# none

#  TAG: balance_on_multiple_ip
#	Modern IP resolvers in squid sort lookup results by preferred access.
#	By default squid will use these IP in order and only rotates to
#	the next listed when the most preffered fails.
#
#	Some load balancing servers based on round robin DNS have been
#	found not to preserve user session state across requests
#	to different IP addresses.
#
#	Enabling this directive Squid rotates IP's per request.
#Default:
# balance_on_multiple_ip off

#  TAG: pipeline_prefetch
#	HTTP clients may send a pipeline of 1+N requests to Squid using a
#	single connection, without waiting for Squid to respond to the first
#	of those requests. This option limits the number of concurrent
#	requests Squid will try to handle in parallel. If set to N, Squid
#	will try to receive and process up to 1+N requests on the same
#	connection concurrently.
#
#	Defaults to 0 (off) for bandwidth management and access logging
#	reasons.
#
#	NOTE: pipelining requires persistent connections to clients.
#
#	WARNING: pipelining breaks NTLM and Negotiate/Kerberos authentication.
#Default:
# Do not pre-parse pipelined requests.

#  TAG: high_response_time_warning	(msec)
#	If the one-minute median response time exceeds this value,
#	Squid prints a WARNING with debug level 0 to get the
#	administrators attention.  The value is in milliseconds.
#Default:
# disabled.

#  TAG: high_page_fault_warning
#	If the one-minute average page fault rate exceeds this
#	value, Squid prints a WARNING with debug level 0 to get
#	the administrators attention.  The value is in page faults
#	per second.
#Default:
# disabled.

#  TAG: high_memory_warning
# Note: This option is only available if Squid is rebuilt with the
#       GNU Malloc with mstats()
#
#	If the memory usage (as determined by gnumalloc, if available and used)
#	exceeds	this amount, Squid prints a WARNING with debug level 0 to get
#	the administrators attention.
#Default:
# disabled.

#  TAG: sleep_after_fork	(microseconds)
#	When this is set to a non-zero value, the main Squid process
#	sleeps the specified number of microseconds after a fork()
#	system call. This sleep may help the situation where your
#	system reports fork() failures due to lack of (virtual)
#	memory. Note, however, if you have a lot of child
#	processes, these sleep delays will add up and your
#	Squid will not service requests for some amount of time
#	until all the child processes have been started.
#	On Windows value less then 1000 (1 milliseconds) are
#	rounded to 1000.
#Default:
# sleep_after_fork 0

#  TAG: windows_ipaddrchangemonitor	on|off
# Note: This option is only available if Squid is rebuilt with the
#       MS Windows
#
#	On Windows Squid by default will monitor IP address changes and will 
#	reconfigure itself after any detected event. This is very useful for
#	proxies connected to internet with dial-up interfaces.
#	In some cases (a Proxy server acting as VPN gateway is one) it could be
#	desiderable to disable this behaviour setting this to 'off'.
#	Note: after changing this, Squid service must be restarted.
#Default:
# windows_ipaddrchangemonitor on

#  TAG: eui_lookup
#	Whether to lookup the EUI or MAC address of a connected client.
#Default:
# eui_lookup on

#  TAG: max_filedescriptors
#	Reduce the maximum number of filedescriptors supported below
#	the usual operating system defaults.
#
#	Remove from squid.conf to inherit the current ulimit setting.
#
#	Note: Changing this requires a restart of Squid. Also
#	not all I/O types supports large values (eg on Windows).
#Default:
# Use operating system limits set by ulimit.
