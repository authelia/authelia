## Introduction

This is a guide on integration of __Authelia__ and [Jira] via the trusted header SSO authentication.

As with all guides in this section it's important you read the [introduction](../introduction.md) first.

## Tested Versions

* Authelia: v4.35.5
* Jira: Unknown
* EasySSO: Unknown

## Before You Begin

This example makes the following assumptions:

* The user accounts with the same names already exist in [Jira].
* You have purchased the third-party plugin from the [Atlassian marketplace](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/1212581/easy-sso-jira-kerberos-ntlm-saml?hosting=server&tab=overview)

## Configuration

To configure [Jira] to trust the `Remote-User` and `Remote-Email` header do the following:

1. Visit the Easy SSO plugin settings
2. Under HTTP configure the `Remote-User` header
3. Check the `Username` checkbox
