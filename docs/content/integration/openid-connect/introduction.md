Authelia can act as an [OpenID Connect 1.0] Provider as part of an open beta. This section details implementation
specifics that can be used for integrating Authelia with an [OpenID Connect 1.0] Relying Party, as well as specific
documentation for some [OpenID Connect 1.0] Relying Party implementations.

See the [OpenID Connect 1.0 Provider](../../configuration/identity-providers/openid-connect/provider.md) and
[OpenID Connect 1.0 Clients](../../configuration/identity-providers/openid-connect/clients.md) configuration guides for
information on how to configure the Authelia [OpenID Connect 1.0] Provider (note the clients guide is for configuring
the registered clients in the provider).

This page is intended as an integration reference point for any implementers who wish to integrate an
[OpenID Connect 1.0] Relying Party (client application) either as a developer or user of the third party Relying Party.

## Audiences

When it comes to [OpenID Connect 1.0] there are effectively two types of audiences. There is the audience embedded in
the [ID Token] which should always include the requesting clients identifier and audience of the [Access Token] and
[Refresh Token]. The intention of the audience in the [ID Token] is used to convey which Relying Party or client was the
intended audience of the token. In contrast the audience of the [Access Token] is used by the Authorization Server or
Resource Server to satisfy an internal policy. You could consider the [ID Token] and it's audience to be a public facing
audience, and the audience of other tokens to be private or have private meaning even when the [Access Token] is using
the [JWT Profile for OAuth 2.0 Access Tokens].

It's also important to note that with the exception of [RFC9068] there is basically no standardized token format for
a [Access Token] or a [Refresh Token]. Therefore there is no way without the use of the [Introspection] endpoint to
determine what audiences these tokens are meant for. It should also be noted that like the scope of a [Refresh Token]
should effectively never change this also applies to the audience of this token.

For these reasons the audience of the [Access Token], [Refresh Token], and [ID Token] are effectively completely
separate and Authelia treats them in this manner. An [ID Token] will always and only have the client identifier of the
specific client that requested it per specification, the [Access Token] will always have the granted audience of the
Authorization Flow or last successful Refresh Flow, and the [Refresh Token] will always have the granted audience of
the Authorization Flow.

For more information about the opaque [Access Token] default see
[Why isn't the Access Token a JSON Web Token? (Frequently Asked Questions)](./frequently-asked-questions.md#why-isnt-the-access-token-a-json-web-token).

## Scope Definitions

The following scope definitions describe each scope supported and the associated effects including the individual claims
returned by granting this scope. By default we do not issue any claims which reveal the users identity which allows
administrators semi-granular control over which claims the client is entitled to.

### openid

This is the default scope for [OpenID Connect 1.0]. This field is forced on every client by the configuration validation
that Authelia does.

*__Important Note:__ The subject identifiers or `sub` [Claim] has been changed to a [RFC4122] UUID V4 to identify the
individual user as per the [Subject Identifier Types] section of the [OpenID Connect 1.0] specification. Please use the
`preferred_username` [Claim] instead.*

|  [Claim]  |   JWT Type    | Authelia Attribute |                         Description                         |
|:---------:|:-------------:|:------------------:|:-----------------------------------------------------------:|
|    iss    |    string     |      hostname      |             The issuer name, determined by URL              |
|    jti    | string(uuid)  |       *N/A*        |     A [RFC4122] UUID V4 representing the JWT Identifier     |
|    rat    |    number     |       *N/A*        |            The time when the token was requested            |
|    exp    |    number     |       *N/A*        |                           Expires                           |
|    iat    |    number     |       *N/A*        |             The time when the token was issued              |
| auth_time |    number     |       *N/A*        |        The time the user authenticated with Authelia        |
|    sub    | string(uuid)  |     opaque id      |    A [RFC4122] UUID V4 linked to the user who logged in     |
|   scope   |    string     |       scopes       |              Granted scopes (space delimited)               |
|    scp    | array[string] |       scopes       |                       Granted scopes                        |
|    aud    | array[string] |       *N/A*        |                          Audience                           |
|    amr    | array[string] |       *N/A*        | An [RFC8176] list of authentication method reference values |
|    azp    |    string     |    id (client)     |                    The authorized party                     |
| client_id |    string     |    id (client)     |                        The client id                        |

### offline_access

This scope is a special scope designed to allow applications to obtain a [Refresh Token] which allows extended access to
an application on behalf of a user. A [Refresh Token] is a special [Access Token] that allows refreshing previously
issued token credentials, effectively it allows the relying party to obtain new tokens periodically.

As per [OpenID Connect 1.0] Section 11 [Offline Access] can only be granted during the [Authorization Code Flow] or a
[Hybrid Flow]. The [Refresh Token] will only ever be returned at the [Token Endpoint] when the client is exchanging
their [OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code].

Generally unless an application supports this and actively requests this scope they should not be granted this scope via
the client configuration.

It is also important to note that we treat a [Refresh Token] as single use and reissue a new [Refresh Token] during the
refresh flow.

### groups

This scope includes the groups the authentication backend reports the user is a member of in the [Claims] of the
[ID Token].

| [Claim] |   JWT Type    | Authelia Attribute |                                               Description                                               |
|:-------:|:-------------:|:------------------:|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
| groups  | array[string] |       groups       | List of user's groups discovered via [authentication](../../configuration/first-factor/introduction.md) |

### email

This scope includes the email information the authentication backend reports about the user in the [Claims] of the
[ID Token].

|     Claim      |   JWT Type    | Authelia Attribute |                        Description                        |
|:--------------:|:-------------:|:------------------:|:---------------------------------------------------------:|
|     email      |    string     |      email[0]      |       The first email address in the list of emails       |
| email_verified |     bool      |       *N/A*        | If the email is verified, assumed true for the time being |
|   alt_emails   | array[string] |     email[1:]      |  All email addresses that are not in the email JWT field  |

### profile

This scope includes the profile information the authentication backend reports about the user in the [Claims] of the
[ID Token].

|       Claim        | JWT Type | Authelia Attribute |               Description                |
|:------------------:|:--------:|:------------------:|:----------------------------------------:|
| preferred_username |  string  |      username      | The username the user used to login with |
|        name        |  string  |    display_name    |          The users display name          |

### Special Scopes

The following scopes represent special permissions granted to a specific token.

#### authelia.bearer.authz

This scope allows the granted access token to be utilized with the bearer authorization scheme on endpoints protected
via Authelia.

The specifics about this scope are discussed in the
[OAuth 2.0 Bearer Token Usage for Authorization Endpoints](oauth-2.0-bearer-token-usage.md#authorization-endpoints)
guide.

## Signing and Encryption Algorithms

[OpenID Connect 1.0] and OAuth 2.0 support a wide variety of signature and encryption algorithms. Authelia supports
a subset of these.

## Parameters

The following section describes advanced parameters which can be used in various endpoints as well as their related
configuration options.

### Response Types

The following describes the supported response types. See the [OAuth 2.0 Multiple Response Type Encoding Practices] for
more technical information. The default response modes column indicates which response modes are allowed by default on
clients configured with this flow type value. The value field is both the required value for the `response_type`
parameter in the authorization request and the
[response_types](../../configuration/identity-providers/openid-connect/clients.md#response_types) client configuration
option.

#### Client Assertion Audience

The client authentication methods which use the JWT Bearer Client Assertions such as `client_secret_jwt` and
`private_key_jwt` **require** that the JWT contains an audience (i.e. the `aud` claim) which exactly matches the
full URL for the [token endpoint](#endpoint-implementations) and it **must** be lowercase.

Per the [RFC7523 Section 3: JWT Format and Processing Requirements](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7523#section-3)
this claim must be compared using [RFC3987 Section 6.2.1: Simple String Comparison] and to assist with making this
predictable for implementers we ensure the comparison is done against the lowercase form of this URL.

## Authentication Method References

Authelia currently supports adding the `amr` [Claim] to the [ID Token] utilizing the [RFC8176] Authentication Method
Reference values.

The values this [Claim] has are not strictly defined by the [OpenID Connect 1.0] specification. As such, some backends may
expect a specification other than [RFC8176] for this purpose. If you have such an application and wish for us to support
it then you're encouraged to create a [feature request](https://www.authelia.com/l/fr).

Below is a list of the potential values we place in the [Claim] and their meaning:

| Value |                           Description                            | Factor | Channel  |
|:-----:|:----------------------------------------------------------------:|:------:|:--------:|
|  mfa  |     User used multiple factors to login (see factor column)      |  N/A   |   N/A    |
|  mca  |    User used multiple channels to login (see channel column)     |  N/A   |   N/A    |
| user  |  User confirmed they were present when using their hardware key  |  N/A   |   N/A    |
|  pin  | User confirmed they are the owner of the hardware key with a pin |  N/A   |   N/A    |
|  pwd  |            User used a username and password to login            |  Know  | Browser  |

## Introspection Signing Algorithm

The following table describes the response from the [Introspection] endpoint depending on the
[introspection_signing_alg](../../configuration/identity-providers/openid-connect/clients.md#introspection_signed_response_alg).

When responding with the Signed [JSON Web Token] the [JSON Web Token] `typ` header has the value of
`token-introspection+jwt`.

| Signing Algorithm |     Encoding     |                     Content Type                     |

## Endpoint Implementations

The following section documents the endpoints we implement and their respective paths. This information can
traditionally be discovered by relying parties that utilize [OpenID Connect Discovery 1.0], however this information may be
useful for clients which do not implement this.

The endpoints can be discovered easily by visiting the Discovery and Metadata endpoints. It is recommended regardless
of your version of Authelia that you utilize this version as it will always produce the correct endpoint URLs. The paths
for the Discovery/Metadata endpoints are part of IANA's well known registration but are also documented in a table
below.

These tables document the endpoints we currently support and their paths in the most recent version of Authelia. The
paths are appended to the end of the primary URL used to access Authelia. The tables use the url
https://auth.example.com as an example of the Authelia root URL which is also the OpenID Connect 1.0 Issuer.

### Well Known Discovery Endpoints

These endpoints can be utilized to discover other endpoints and metadata about the Authelia OP.

## Security

The following information covers some security topics some users may wish to be familiar with. All of these elements
offer hardening to the flows in differing ways (i.e. some validate the authorization server and some validate the
client / relying party) which are not essential but recommended.

#### Pushed Authorization Requests Endpoint

The [Pushed Authorization Requests] endpoint is discussed in depth in [RFC9126] as well as in the
[OAuth 2.0 Pushed Authorization Requests](https://oauth.net/2/pushed-authorization-requests/) documentation.

Essentially it's a special endpoint that takes the same parameters as the [Authorization] endpoint (including
[Proof Key Code Exchange](#proof-key-code-exchange)) with a few caveats:

1. The same [Client Authentication] mechanism required by the [Token] endpoint **MUST** be used.
2. The request **MUST** use the [HTTP POST method].
3. The request **MUST** use the `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` content type (i.e. the parameters **MUST** be in the
   body, not the URI).
4. The request **MUST** occur over the back-channel.

The response of this endpoint is [JSON] encoded with two key-value pairs:

  - `request_uri`
  - `expires_in`

The `expires_in` indicates how long the `request_uri` is valid for. The `request_uri` is used as a parameter to the
[Authorization] endpoint instead of the standard parameters (as the `request_uri` parameter).

The advantages of this approach are as follows:

1. [Pushed Authorization Requests] cannot be created or influenced by any party other than the Relying Party (client).
2. Since you can force all [Authorization] requests to be initiated via [Pushed Authorization Requests] you drastically
   improve the authorization flows resistance to phishing attacks (this can be done globally or on a per-client basis).
3. Since the [Pushed Authorization Requests] endpoint requires all of the same [Client Authentication] mechanisms as the
   [Token] endpoint:
   1. Clients using the confidential [Client Type] can't have [Pushed Authorization Requests] generated by parties who do not
      have the credentials.
   2. Clients using the public [Client Type] and utilizing [Proof Key Code Exchange](#proof-key-code-exchange) never
      transmit the verifier over any front-channel making even the `plain` challenge method relatively secure.

#### OAuth 2.0 Authorization Server Issuer Identification

The [RFC9207: OAuth 2.0 Authorization Server Issuer Identification] implementation allows relying parties to validate
the Authorization Response was returned by the expected issuer by ensuring the response includes the exact issuer in
the response. This is an additional check in addition to the `state` parameter.

This validation is not supported by many clients but it should be utilized if it is supported.

#### JWT Secured Authorization Response Mode (JARM)

The [JWT Secured Authorization Response Mode for OAuth 2.0 (JARM)] implementation similar to
[OAuth 2.0 Authorization Server Issuer Identification](#oauth-20-authorization-server-issuer-identification) allows a
relying party to ensure the Authorization Response was returned by the expected issuer and also ensures the response
was not tampered with or forged as it is cryptographically signed.

This response mode is not supported by many clients but we recommend it is used if it's supported.

#### Proof Key Code Exchange

The [Proof Key Code Exchange] mechanism is discussed in depth in [RFC7636] as well as in the
[OAuth 2.0 Proof Key Code Exchange](https://oauth.net/2/pkce/) documentation.

Essentially a random opaque value is generated by the Relying Party and optionally (but recommended) passed through a
SHA256 hash. The original value is saved by the Relying Party, and the hashed value is sent in the [Authorization]
request in the `code_verifier` parameter with the `code_challenge_method` set to `S256` (or `plain` using a bad practice
of not hashing the opaque value).

When the Relying Party requests the token from the [Token] endpoint, they must include the `code_verifier` parameter
again (in the body), but this time they send the value without it being hashed.

The advantages of this approach are as follows:

1. Provided the value was hashed it's certain that the Relying Party which generated the authorization request is the
   same party as the one requesting the token or is permitted by the Relying Party to make this request.
2. Even when using the public [Client Type] there is a form of authentication on the  [Token] endpoint.
