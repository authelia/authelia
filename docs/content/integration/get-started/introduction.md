## Overview

The process for setting up Authelia has been broken up into three key parts. We separate the steps like we do as each
step is highly dependent on your integration goals and we can't make a dedicated guide for every scenario. For this same
reason you may have to adapt the examples to your particular scenario, though the documentation variables you may see
throughout this guide help alleviate this particular issue.

We recommend you complete reading this page, then we recommend following these steps:

1. [Configuration](configuration.md)
2. [Deployment](deployment.md)
3. [Proxy](proxy.md) Integration

## Comprehensive Examples

Some people may prefer a more comprehensive fully setup example. For this purpose we've setup several bundled examples
which include a helpful folder layout. Each of these examples utilize [docker compose] to setup the environment.

We have a dedicated guide for each of these bundles to explain how to use them most effectively. We also design the
bundles intentionally to make them easy to customize to most use cases.
