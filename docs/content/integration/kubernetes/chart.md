Authelia offers a [Helm Chart] which can make integration with [Kubernetes] much easier. It's currently considered beta
status, and as such is subject to breaking changes.

## Get started

It's __*strongly recommended*__ that users setting up *Authelia* for the first time take a look at our
[Get started](../prologue/get-started.md) guide. This takes you through various steps which are essential to
bootstrapping *Authelia*.

## Repository

The [Helm Chart] repository for Authelia is `https://charts.authelia.com`. You can add it to your repository list with
the following [Helm] commands:

```bash
helm repo add authelia https://charts.authelia.com
helm repo update
```

## Authenticity Signature

The chart is signed using the [Authelia PGP Keys](https://keybase.io/authelia/pgp_keys.asc).

## Website

The [https://charts.authelia.com/](https://charts.authelia.com/) URL also serves a website with basic chart information.

## Source

The source for the [Helm Chart] is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/authelia/chartrepo). Please feel free to
