This mechanism is supported by proxies which inject certain response headers from Authelia into the protected
application. This is a very basic means that allows the target application to identify the user who is logged in
to Authelia. This like all single-sign on technologies requires support by the protected application.

You can read more about this in the [Trusted Header SSO Integration Guide](../../integration/trusted-header-sso/introduction.md).
