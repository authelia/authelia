[OpenID Connect 1.0](https://openid.net/connect/) is a authorization identity framework supported by Authelia. You can
configure your applications to use Authelia as an [OpenID Connect 1.0 Provider](https://openid.net/connect/). We do not
currently operate as an [OpenID Connect 1.0 Relying Party](https://openid.net/connect/). This like all single-sign on
technologies requires support by the protected application.

See the [OpenID Connect 1.0 Provider Configuration Guide](../../configuration/identity-providers/openid-connect/provider.md),  and the
[OpenID Connect 1.0 Integration Guide](../../integration/openid-connect/introduction.md) for more information.

## Protocol Support

The [Support Chart](../../integration/openid-connect/introduction.md#support-chart) lists the OAuth 2.0 and OpenID
Connect 1.0 specifications and protocols we support.

## OpenID Certified™

Authelia is [OpenID Certified™] to conform to the [OpenID Connect™ protocol].
