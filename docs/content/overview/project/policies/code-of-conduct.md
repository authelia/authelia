## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our
community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender
identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status,
nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity
and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming,
diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our
community include:

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes,
  and learning from the experience
* Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the
  overall community

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or
  advances of any kind
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email
  address, without their explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered to be inappropriate in a
  professional setting

### Focused on Technology

Authelia is focused solely on the technology itself. We aim to remain completely
neutral in all ideological, political, and other controversial matters. We
consider this a professional standard within the community. This aligns with our
second guiding standard; being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and
experiences.

While we will not be expressly strict about this and we will be somewhat permissive
of such topics, we discourage them and there are a few guidelines to be aware of.
The core intent by these guidelines is that we do not want unrelated matters to
cause a divide within our community, there are other more appropriate communities
to have these disagreements.

Discussion about topics which can reasonably be categorized like this or are
otherwise not related to technology should strictly be conducted in off topic
areas of the community. These discussions must at all times be professional and
civilized.

If you believe one of these topics is not in line with other areas of our code
of conduct we strongly urge people to not engage in the discussion and instead
bring it to the attention of a community leader.

At any point if a community leader requests that any non-technical discussion
should not continue then all parties will immediately respect and adhere to
such a request without disagreement.

In the event that one of these topics becomes a heated argument within all
likelihood action will be taken against all parties still involved as to avoid
taking any particular stance on any non-technical disagreement. The actions
taken will be as described in this code of conduct.

### Generative AI

There is an emerging convenience of Generative AI that's becoming very
popular. It's quite apparent that Generative AI is an amazing tool that is
very useful in saving precious time. While we're welcoming of the
technology we have the expectation of ourselves that we clearly communicate
where and how we're using it.

The rational behind this is that it's quite clear Generative AI can make some
serious and critical mistakes which may or may not be clear when considered
rationally. The issue is that it's very good at getting most things to appear
correct, and it's very easy to miss a serious and critical mistake when you're
not considering the fact something was produced via Generative AI.

This is based on professionalism that we also expect from every user in the
community. This does not solely apply to the obvious elements such as pull requests;
but also applies to the creation of feature requests, bug reports, discussions,
and general communication within the community.

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of
acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive,
or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are
not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation
decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when
an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.
Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address,
posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at
team@authelia.com.
All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the
reporter of any incident.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining
the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

### 1. Correction

**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed
unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

**Consequence**: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing
clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the
behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

### 2. Warning

**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series
of actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No
interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with
those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This
includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels
like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or
permanent ban.

### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including
sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public
communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or
private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction
with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period.
Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

### 4. Permanent Ban

**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community
standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior,  harassment of an
