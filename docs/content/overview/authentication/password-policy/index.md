Password policy enforces security by requiring the users to use strong passwords.

Currently, two methods are supported:

## classic

This mode of operation allows administrators to set the rules that user passwords must comply with when changing their
password.

The available options are:

* Minimum password length
* Require Uppercase
* Require Lowercase
* Require Numbers
* Require Special characters

## zxcvbn

This mode uses [zxcvbn](https://github.com/dropbox/zxcvbn) for password strength checking. In this mode of operation,
the user is not forced to follow any rules. The user is notified if their passwords is weak or strong.
