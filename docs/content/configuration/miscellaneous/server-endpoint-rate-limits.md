__Authelia__  imposes default rate limits on specific endpoints which can prevent faulty clients or bad actors from
consuming too many resources or using brute-force to potentially compromise security. This should not be confused with
[Regulation](../security/regulation.md) which is used to silently ban users from using the username / password form.

## Configuration

#### period

{{< confkey type="string,integer" syntax="duration" required="situational">}}

Configures the period of time the tokenized bucket applies to.
