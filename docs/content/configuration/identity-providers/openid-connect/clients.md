## Options

### client_id

{{< confkey type="string" required="yes" >}}

{{< callout context="caution" title="Important Note" icon="outline/alert-triangle" >}}
We generally recommend using a semi-long random alphanumeric string for this value. See below for
specific limitations.
{{< /callout >}}

The Client ID for this client. It must exactly match the Client ID configured in the application consuming this client.

Valid Client ID's have the following characteristics:

- Less than or equal to 100 characters.
- Only contains [RFC3986 Unreserved Characters](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3986#section-2.3).
- Completely unique from other configured clients.

### client_name

{{< confkey type="string" default="*same as id*" required="no" >}}

A friendly name for this client shown in the UI. This defaults to the same as the ID.

### client_secret

{{< confkey type="string" required="situational" >}}

The shared secret between Authelia and the application consuming this client. This secret must match the secret
configured in the application.

This secret must be generated by the administrator and can be done by following the
[How Do I Generate a Client Identifier or Client Secret](../../../integration/openid-connect/frequently-asked-questions.md#how-do-i-generate-a-client-identifier-or-client-secret) FAQ.

This must be provided when the client is a confidential client type provided with the exception if you've configured a
[token_endpoint_auth_method](#token_endpoint_auth_method) that uses a credential type that isn't a secret (i.e. a key), and
must be blank when using the public client type. To set the client type to public see the [public](#public)
configuration option.

### sector_identifier_uri

{{< confkey type="string" required="no" >}}

{{< callout context="caution" title="Important Note" icon="outline/alert-triangle" >}}
Because adjusting this option will inevitably change the `sub` claim of all tokens generated for
the specified client, changing this should cause the relying party to detect all future authorizations as completely new
users.
{{< /callout >}}

{{< callout context="caution" title="Important Note" icon="outline/alert-triangle" >}}
This **must** either not be configured at all i.e. commented or completely absent from the
configuration, or it must be an absolute HTTPS URL which contains a valid sector identifier JSON document. Configuration
of this option with the `https://` scheme per the requirements will cause Authelia to validate this JSON document.
{{< /callout >}}

A valid `sector_identifier_uri` will:
  1. Have the scheme `https://`.
  2. Be the absolute URI of a JSON document which:
     1. Is a JSON array of strings (URIs).
     2. Has every URI registered with this clients [redirect_uris](#redirect_uris) when compared using an exact string
        match as defined in [OAuth 2.0 Security Best Current Practice Section 2.1].
     3. May or may not have additional [redirect_uris](#redirect_uris) from other clients.

[OAuth 2.0 Security Best Current Practice Section 2.1]: https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-oauth-security-topics#section-2.1

Authelia utilizes UUID version 4 subject identifiers. By default the public [Subject Identifier Type] is utilized for
all clients. This means the subject identifiers will be the same for all clients. This configuration option enables
[Pairwise Identifier Algorithm] for this client, and configures the sector identifier utilized for both the storage and
the lookup of the subject identifier.

1. All clients who do not have this configured will generate the same subject identifier for a particular user
   regardless of which client obtains the ID token.
2. All clients which have the same sector identifier will:
   1. Have the same subject identifier for a particular user when compared to clients with the same sector identifier.
   2. Have a completely different subject identifier for a particular user when compared to:
      1. Any client with the public subject identifier type.
      2. Any client with a differing `sector_identifier_uri`.

In specific but limited scenarios this option is beneficial for privacy reasons. In particular this is useful when the
party utilizing the *Authelia* [OpenID Connect 1.0] Authorization Server is foreign and not controlled by the user. It would
prevent the third party utilizing the subject identifier with another third party in order to track the user.

Keep in mind depending on the other claims they may still be able to perform this tracking and it is not a silver
bullet. There are very few benefits when utilizing this in a homelab or business where no third party is utilizing
the server.

### public

{{< confkey type="boolean" default="false" required="no" >}}

This enables the public client type for this client. This is for clients that are not capable of maintaining
confidentiality of credentials, you can read more about client types in [RFC6749 Section 2.1]. This is particularly
useful for SPA's and CLI tools. This option requires setting the [client secret](#client_secret) to a blank string.

### redirect_uris

{{< confkey type="list(string)" required="yes" >}}

A list of valid callback URIs this client will redirect to. All other callbacks will be considered unsafe. The URIs are
case-sensitive and they differ from application to application - the community has provided
[a list of URLÂ´s for common applications](../../../integration/openid-connect/introduction.md).

Some restrictions that have been placed on clients and
their redirect URIs are as follows:

1. If a client attempts to authorize with Authelia and its redirect URI is not listed in the client configuration the
   attempt to authorize will fail and an error will be generated.
2. The redirect URIs are case-sensitive.
3. The URI must include a scheme and that scheme must be one of `http` or `https`.

### request_uris

{{< confkey type="list(string)" required="no" >}}

A list of URIs which can be used for the OpenID Connect 1.0 Request Object to pass Authorize Request parameters via a
JSON Web Token remote URI using the `request_uri` parameter.

These URIs must have the `https` scheme.

### audience

{{< confkey type="list(string)" required="no" >}}

A whitelist of audiences this client is allowed to request. These audiences were previously automatically granted to all
access requests unless specifically requested otherwise. The current behavior is only those requested by the client in
the `audience` parameter are granted. This behavior can be tuned using the
[requested_audience_mode](#requested_audience_mode).

This value does not affect the issued ID Tokens as they are always issued with the client identifier being the audience.

### scopes

{{< confkey type="list(string)" default="openid,groups,profile,email" required="no" >}}

A list of scopes to allow this client to consume. See
[scope definitions](../../../integration/openid-connect/introduction.md#scope-definitions) for more information. The
documentation for the application you are trying to configure [OpenID Connect 1.0] for will likely have a list of scopes
or claims required which can be matched with the above guide.

The scope values should generally be one of those documented in the
[scope definitions](../../../integration/openid-connect/introduction.md#scope-definitions) with the exception of when a client requires a specific scope we do not define. Users should
expect to see a warning in the logs if they configure a scope not in our definitions with the exception of a client
where the configured [grant_types](#grant_types) includes the `client_credentials` grant in which case arbitrary scopes are
expected,

### grant_types

{{< confkey type="list(string)" default="authorization_code" required="no" >}}

{{< callout context="caution" title="Important Note" icon="outline/alert-triangle" >}}
It is recommended that this isn't configured at this time unless you know what you're doing.
{{< /callout >}}

The list of grant types this client is permitted to use in order to obtain access to the token endpoint to obtain the
granted tokens.

See the [Grant Types](../../../integration/openid-connect/introduction.md#grant-types) section of the
[OpenID Connect 1.0 Integration Guide](../../../integration/openid-connect/introduction.md#grant-types) for more information.

### response_types

{{< confkey type="list(string)" default="code" required="no" >}}

{{< callout context="danger" title="Security Note" icon="outline/alert-octagon" >}}
It is recommended that only the `code` response type (i.e. the default) is used. The other response
types are not as secure as this response type.
{{< /callout >}}

A list of response types this client supports. If a response type not in this list is requested by a client then an
error will be returned to the client. The response type indicates the types of values that are returned to the client.

See the [Response Types](../../../integration/openid-connect/introduction.md#response-types) section of the
[OpenID Connect 1.0 Integration Guide](../../../integration/openid-connect/introduction.md#response-types) for more information.

### response_modes

{{< confkey type="list(string)" default="form_post,query" required="no" >}}

{{< callout context="caution" title="Important Note" icon="outline/alert-triangle" >}}
It is recommended that this isn't configured at this time unless you know what you're doing.
{{< /callout >}}

A list of response modes this client supports. If a response mode not in this list is requested by a client then an
error will be returned to the client. The response mode controls how the response type is returned to the client.

See the [Response Modes](../../../integration/openid-connect/introduction.md#response-modes) section of the
[OpenID Connect 1.0 Integration Guide](../../../integration/openid-connect/introduction.md#response-modes) for more
information.

The default values are based on the [response_types](#response_types) values. When the [response_types](#response_types)
values include the `code` type then the `query` response mode will be included. When any other type is included the
`fragment` response mode will be included. It's important to note at this time we do not support the `none` response
type, but when it is supported it will include the `query` response mode.

### authorization_policy

{{< confkey type="string" default="two_factor" required="no" >}}

The authorization policy for this client: either `one_factor`, `two_factor`, or one of the ones configured in the
provider [authorization_policies](./provider.md#authorization_policies) section.

The follow example shows a policy named `policy_name` which will `deny` access to users in the `services` group, with
a default policy of `two_factor` for everyone else. This policy is applied to the client with id
`client_with_policy_name`. You should refer to the [authorization_policies](./provider.md#authorization_policies)
section for more in depth information.

```yaml {title="configuration.yml"}
identity_providers:
  oidc:
    authorization_policies:
      policy_name:
        default_policy: 'two_factor'
        rules:
          - policy: 'deny'
            subject: 'group:services'
    clients:
      - client_id: 'client_with_policy_name'
        authorization_policy: 'policy_name'
```

### lifespan

{{< confkey type="string" default="" required="no" >}}

The name of the custom lifespan that this client uses. A custom lifespan is named and configured globally via the
[custom](provider.md#custom) section within [lifespans](provider.md#lifespans).

### claims_policy

{{< confkey type="string" default="" required="no" >}}

The name of the claims policy that this client uses. A claims policy is named and configured globally via the
[claims_policies](provider.md#claims_policies) for the OpenID Connect 1.0 Provider.

### requested_audience_mode

{{< confkey type="string" default="explicit" required="no" >}}

Controls the effective audience the client has requested. The following table describes the possible values and their
behavior. This value does not affect the issued ID Tokens as they are always issued with the client identifier being
the audience.

|  Value   |                                                   Description                                                    |
|:--------:|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
| explicit |     Requires the client explicitly requests an audiences for an audience to be included in the issued tokens     |
| implicit | Assumes if the client is requesting all audiences it is permitted to request if the audience parameter is absent |

### consent_mode

{{< confkey type="string" default="auto" required="no" >}}

{{< callout context="caution" title="Important Note" icon="outline/alert-triangle" >}}
The `implicit` consent mode is not technically part of the specification. It theoretically could be
misused in certain conditions specifically with the public client type or when the client credentials (i.e. client
secret) has been exposed to an attacker. For these reasons this mode is discouraged.
{{< /callout >}}

Configures the consent mode. The following table describes the different modes:

|     Value      |                                                                  Description                                                                   |
|:--------------:|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
|      auto      | Automatically determined (default). Uses `explicit` unless [pre_configured_consent_duration] is specified in which case uses `pre-configured`. |
|    explicit    |                                   Requires the user provide unique explicit consent for every authorization.                                   |
|    implicit    |                   Automatically assumes consent for every authorization, never asking the user if they wish to give consent.                   |
| pre-configured |                            Allows the end-user to remember their consent for the [pre_configured_consent_duration].                            |

[pre_configured_consent_duration]: #pre_configured_consent_duration

### pre_configured_consent_duration

{{< confkey type="string,integer" syntax="duration" default="1 week" required="no" >}}

Specifying this in the configuration without a consent [consent_mode] enables the `pre-configured` mode. If this is
specified as well as the [consent_mode] then it only has an effect if the [consent_mode] is `pre-configured` or `auto`.

The period of time dictates how long a users choice to remember the pre-configured consent lasts.

Pre-configured consents are only valid if the subject, client id are exactly the same and the requested scopes/audience
match exactly with the granted scopes/audience.

[consent_mode]: #consent_mode

### require_pushed_authorization_requests

{{< confkey type="boolean" default="false" required="no" >}}

{{< callout context="caution" title="Important Note" icon="outline/alert-triangle" >}}
A majority of clients will not support this option as it requires a special but highly secure
authorization flow.
{{< /callout >}}

This configuration option enforces the use of a [Pushed Authorization Requests] flow for this registered client.
To enforce it for all clients see the global [pushed_authorizations enforce](provider.md#enforce) provider configuration
option.

### require_pkce

{{< confkey type="boolean" default="false" required="no" >}}

This configuration option enforces the use of [PKCE] for this registered client. To enforce it for all clients see the
global [enforce_pkce](provider.md#enforce_pkce) provider configuration option.

### pkce_challenge_method

{{< confkey type="string" default="" required="no" >}}

This setting enforces the use of the specified [PKCE] challenge method for this individual client. This setting also
effectively enables the [require_pkce](#require_pkce) option for this client.

Valid values are an empty string, `plain`, or `S256`. It should be noted that `S256` is strongly recommended if the
relying party supports it.

### authorization_signed_response_alg

{{< confkey type="string" default="none" required="no" >}}

{{< callout context="caution" title="Important Note" icon="outline/alert-triangle" >}}
A majority of clients will not support this option as the whole authorization response will be a
signed and/or encrypted JWT with additional tokens embedded into it.
{{< /callout >}}

{{< callout context="note" title="Note" icon="outline/info-circle" >}}
This value is completely ignored if the
[authorization_signed_response_key_id](#authorization_signed_response_key_id) is defined.
{{< /callout >}}

The algorithm used to sign the authorization responses.

See the response object section of the
[integration guide](../../../integration/openid-connect/introduction.md#response-object) for more information including
the algorithm column for supported values.

With the exclusion of `none` which returns a traditional authorization response, the algorithm chosen must have a key
configured in the [jwks] section to be considered valid.

See the response object section of the [integration guide](../../../integration/openid-connect/introduction.md#response-object)
for more information including the algorithm column for supported values.

### authorization_signed_response_key_id

{{< confkey type="string" required="no" >}}

{{< callout context="caution" title="Important Note" icon="outline/alert-triangle" >}}
A majority of clients will not support this option as the whole authorization response will be a
signed and/or encrypted JWT with additional tokens embedded into it.
{{< /callout >}}

{{< callout context="note" title="Note" icon="outline/info-circle" >}}
This value automatically configures the [authorization_signed_response_alg](#authorization_signed_response_alg)
value with the algorithm of the specified key.
{{< /callout >}}

The key id of the JWK used to sign the ID Tokens in the token responses. The value of this must one of those provided or
calculated in the [jwks].

### id_token_signed_response_alg

{{< confkey type="string" default="RS256" required="no" >}}

{{< callout context="note" title="Note" icon="outline/info-circle" >}}
This value is completely ignored if the [id_token_signed_response_key_id](#id_token_signed_response_key_id)
is defined.
{{< /callout >}}

The algorithm used to sign the ID Tokens in the token responses.

See the response object section of the
[integration guide](../../../integration/openid-connect/introduction.md#response-object) for more information including
the algorithm column for supported values. This value can not be set to `none`.

The algorithm chosen must have a key configured in the [jwks] section to be considered valid.

See the response object section of the [integration guide](../../../integration/openid-connect/introduction.md#response-object)
for more information including the algorithm column for supported values.

### id_token_signed_response_key_id

{{< confkey type="string" required="no" >}}

{{< callout context="note" title="Note" icon="outline/info-circle" >}}
This value automatically configures the [id_token_signed_response_alg](#id_token_signed_response_alg) value
with the algorithm of the specified key.
{{< /callout >}}

The key id of the JWK used to sign the ID Tokens in the token responses. The value of this must one of those provided or
calculated in the issuer [jwks] section.

### access_token_signed_response_alg

{{< confkey type="string" default="none" required="no" >}}

{{< callout context="note" title="Note" icon="outline/info-circle" >}}
This value is completely ignored if the [access_token_signed_response_key_id](#access_token_signed_response_key_id)
is defined.
{{< /callout >}}

The algorithm used to sign the JWT Access Tokens in the token responses.

See the response object section of the
[integration guide](../../../integration/openid-connect/introduction.md#response-object) for more information including
the algorithm column for supported values. This value can not be set to `none`.

The algorithm chosen must have a key configured in the issuer [jwks] section to
be considered valid. In addition to the values listed we also support `none` as a value
for this endpoint. When using the `none` value the Access Token is completely opaque and is not a JWT.

See the response object section of the [integration guide](../../../integration/openid-connect/introduction.md#response-object)
for more information including the algorithm column for supported values.

### access_token_signed_response_key_id

{{< confkey type="string" required="no" >}}

{{< callout context="note" title="Note" icon="outline/info-circle" >}}
This value automatically configures the [access_token_signed_response_alg](#access_token_signed_response_alg) value with the
algorithm of the specified key.
{{< /callout >}}

The key id of the JWK used to sign the [JWT Access Tokens](https://oauth.net/2/jwt-access-tokens/) in the token
responses. The value of this must one of those provided or calculated in the
issuer [jwks] section.

### userinfo_signed_response_alg

{{< confkey type="string" default="none" required="no" >}}

{{< callout context="note" title="Note" icon="outline/info-circle" >}}
This value is completely ignored if the [userinfo_signed_response_key_id](#userinfo_signed_response_key_id) is defined.
{{< /callout >}}

The algorithm used to sign the userinfo endpoint responses.

See the response object section of the [integration guide](../../../integration/openid-connect/introduction.md#response-object)
for more information including the algorithm column for supported values. In addition to the values listed we also
support `none` as a value for this endpoint.

The algorithm chosen must have a key configured in the issuer [jwks] section to
be considered valid.

### userinfo_signed_response_key_id

{{< confkey type="string" required="no" >}}

{{< callout context="note" title="Note" icon="outline/info-circle" >}}
This value automatically configures the [userinfo_signed_response_alg](#userinfo_signed_response_alg) value
with the algorithm of the specified key.
{{< /callout >}}

The key id of the JWK used to sign the userinfo endpoint responses in the token responses. The value of this must one of
those provided or calculated in the
issuer [jwks] section.

### introspection_signed_response_alg

{{< confkey type="string" default="none" required="no" >}}

{{< callout context="note" title="Note" icon="outline/info-circle" >}}
This value is completely ignored if the
[introspection_signed_response_key_id](#introspection_signed_response_key_id) is defined.
{{< /callout >}}

The algorithm used to sign the Introspection response. By default it is set to `none` which results in the response
not being signed and the encoding being JSON.

If configured to any other value the response is a JWT in the `application/token-introspection+jwt` format.

See the response object section of the [integration guide](../../../integration/openid-connect/introduction.md#response-object)
for more information including the algorithm column for supported values.

The algorithm chosen must have a key configured in the issuer [jwks] section to be considered valid.

### introspection_signed_response_key_id

{{< confkey type="string" required="no" >}}

{{< callout context="note" title="Note" icon="outline/info-circle" >}}
This value automatically configures the [introspection_signed_response_alg](#introspection_signed_response_alg)
value with the algorithm of the specified key.
{{< /callout >}}

The key id of the JWK used to sign the Introspection responses. The value of this must one of those provided or
calculated in the issuer [jwks] section.

### request_object_signing_alg

{{< confkey type="string" default="RS256" required="no" >}}

The JWT signing algorithm accepted for request objects.

See the request object section of the
[integration guide](../../../integration/openid-connect/introduction.md#request-object) for more information including
the algorithm column for supported values.

### token_endpoint_auth_method

{{< confkey type="string" default="client_secret_basic" required="no" >}}

The registered client authentication mechanism used by this client for the [Token Endpoint]. If no method is defined
the confidential client type will default to `client_secret_basic` as this is required by the specification. The public
client type defaults to `none` as this is required by the specification. Supported values are `client_secret_basic`,
`client_secret_post`, `client_secret_jwt`, `private_key_jwt`, and `none`.

See the [integration guide](../../../integration/openid-connect/introduction.md#client-authentication-method) for
more information.

### token_endpoint_auth_signing_alg

{{< confkey type="string" default="RS256" required="no" >}}

The JWT signing algorithm accepted when the [token_endpoint_auth_method](#token_endpoint_auth_method) is configured as
`client_secret_jwt` or `private_key_jwt`.

See the request object section of the [integration guide](../../../integration/openid-connect/introduction.md#request-object)
for more information including the algorithm column for supported values.

It's recommended that you specifically configure this when the following options are configured to specific values
otherwise we assume the default value:

|                   Configuration Option                    |        Value        | Default |
|:---------------------------------------------------------:|:-------------------:|:-------:|
| [token_endpoint_auth_method](#token_endpoint_auth_method) |  `private_key_jwt`  | `RS256` |
| [token_endpoint_auth_method](#token_endpoint_auth_method) | `client_secret_jwt` | `HS256` |

### allow_multiple_auth_methods

{{< confkey type="boolean" default="false" required="no" >}}

[RFC6749: Section 2.3](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749#section-2.3) clearly indicates that clients have no
option but to use a single authentication method in any single request. Authelia by default enforces this behavior, this
is an escape hatch to turn this policy off for a particular client.

Per the text:

{{< callout context="danger" title="RFC6749: Section 2.3" icon="outline/alert-octagon" >}}
The client MUST NOT use more than one authentication method in each request.
{{< /callout >}}

### jwks_uri

{{< confkey type="string" required="situational" >}}

{{< callout context="caution" title="Important Note" icon="outline/alert-triangle" >}}
The URL given in this value MUST be resolvable by Authelia and MUST present a certificate signed by
a certificate trusted by your environment. It is beyond our intentions to support anything other than this.
{{< /callout >}}

The fully qualified, `https` scheme, and appropriately signed URI for the JWKs endpoint that implements
[RFC7517 Section 5](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7517#section-5).This is mutually exclusive with [jwks](#jwks), meaning they must not be configured at the same
time. It's recommended that you configure this option to account for key rotation instead of [jwks](#jwks).

This option or the [jwks](#jwks) option configures the trusted JSON Web Keys or JWKs for this registered client.
This section is situationally required. These are used to validate the [JWT] assertions from clients.

Required when the following options are configured:

- [request_object_signing_alg](#request_object_signing_alg)
- [token_endpoint_auth_signing_alg](#token_endpoint_auth_signing_alg)

Required when the following options are configured to specific values:

- [token_endpoint_auth_method](#token_endpoint_auth_method): `private_key_jwt`

The following is a contextual example (see below for information regarding each option):

```yaml {title="configuration.yml"}
identity_providers:
  oidc:
    clients:
      - client_id: 'example'
        jwks_uri: 'https://oidc.{{< sitevar name="domain" nojs="example.com" >}}:8080/oauth2/jwks.json'
        jwks:
          - key_id: 'example'
            algorithm: 'RS256'
            use: 'sig'
            key: |
              -----BEGIN RSA PUBLIC KEY-----
              ...
              -----END RSA PUBLIC KEY-----
            certificate_chain: |
              -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
              ...
              -----END CERTIFICATE-----
              -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
              ...
              -----END CERTIFICATE-----
```

### jwks

{{< confkey type="list(object)" required="situational" >}}

A list of manually configured JSON Web Keys. This is mutually exclusive with [jwks_uri](#jwks_uri), meaning they must
not be configured at the same time. It's recommended that you configure the [jwks_uri](#jwks_uri) option to account for
key rotation instead of this option.

This option or the [jwks_uri](#jwks_uri) option configures the trusted JSON Web Keys or JWKs for this registered client.
This section is situationally required. These are used to validate the [JWT] assertions from clients.

Required when the following options are configured:

- [request_object_signing_alg](#request_object_signing_alg)
- [token_endpoint_auth_signing_alg](#token_endpoint_auth_signing_alg)

Required when the following options are configured to specific values:

- [token_endpoint_auth_method](#token_endpoint_auth_method): `private_key_jwt`

#### key_id

{{< confkey type="string" required="yes" >}}

The Key ID used to match the request object's JWT header `kid` value against.

#### use

{{< confkey type="string" default="sig" required="no" >}}

The key usage. Defaults to `sig` which is the only available option at this time.

#### algorithm

{{< confkey type="string" default="RS256" required="situational" >}}

The algorithm for this key. This value typically optional as it can be automatically detected based on the type of key
in some situations. It is however strongly recommended this is set.

See the request object table in the [integration guide](../../../integration/openid-connect/introduction.md#request-object)
for more information. The `Algorithm` column lists supported values, the `Key` column references the required
[key](#key) type constraints that exist for the algorithm, and the `JWK Default Conditions` column briefly explains the
conditions under which it's the default algorithm.

#### key

{{< confkey type="string" required="yes" >}}

The public key portion of the JSON Web Key.

The public key the clients use to sign/encrypt the [OpenID Connect 1.0] asserted [JWT]'s. The key is generated by the
client application or the administrator of the client application.

The key *__MUST__*:

* Be a PEM block encoded in the DER base64 format ([RFC4648]).
* Be either:
  * An RSA public key:
    * Encoded in conformance to the [PKCS#8] or [PKCS#1] specifications.
    * Have a key size of at least 2048 bits.
  * An ECDSA public key:
    * Encoded in conformance to the [PKCS#8] or [SECG1] specifications.
    * Use one of the following elliptical curves:
      * P-256.
      * P-384.
      * P-512.

[PKCS#8]: https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5208
[PKCS#1]: https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8017
[SECG1]: https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5915

If the [certificate_chain](#certificate_chain) is provided the private key must include matching public
key data for the first certificate in the chain.

#### certificate_chain

{{< confkey type="string" required="no" >}}

The certificate chain/bundle to be used with the [key](#key) DER base64 ([RFC4648])
encoded PEM format used to sign/encrypt the [OpenID Connect 1.0] [JWT]'s.
