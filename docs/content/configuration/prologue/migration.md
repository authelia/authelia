This section discusses the change to the configuration over time. Since v4.36.0 the migration process is automatically
performed where possible in memory (the file is unchanged). The automatic process generates warnings and the automatic
migrations are disabled in major version bumps.

If you're running a version prior to v4.36.0 this it may require manual migration by the administrator. Typically this
only occurs when a configuration key is renamed or moved to a more appropriate location.

## Format

The migrations are formatted in a table with the old key and the new key. Periods indicate a different section which can
be represented in [YAML] as a dictionary i.e. it's indented.

In our table `server.host` with a value of `0.0.0.0` is represented in [YAML] like this:

```yaml {title="configuration.yml"}
server:
  host: '0.0.0.0'
```

You can't define secrets for providers that you are not using. For example if you're using the
[filesystem notifier](../notifications/introduction.md) you must ensure that the `AUTHELIA_NOTIFIER_SMTP_PASSWORD_FILE`
environment variable or other environment variables set. This also applies to other providers like
[storage](../storage/introduction.md) and [authentication backend](../first-factor/introduction.md).

If you're using Authelia with Kubernetes and are not using the provided
[helm chart](https://charts.authelia.com) you will be required to
[configure the enableServiceLinks](../../integration/kubernetes/introduction.md#enable-service-links) option.

### 4.25.0

The following changes occurred in 4.25.0:

|                  Previous Key                   |                     New Key                     |
|:-----------------------------------------------:|:-----------------------------------------------:|
|   authentication_backend.ldap.tls.skip_verify   |   authentication_backend.ldap.tls.skip_verify   |
| authentication_backend.ldap.minimum_tls_version | authentication_backend.ldap.tls.minimum_version |
|        notifier.smtp.disable_verify_cert        |          notifier.smtp.tls.skip_verify          |
|           notifier.smtp.trusted_cert            |             certificates_directory              |

{{< callout context="note" title="Note" icon="outline/info-circle" >}}
The `certificates_directory` is not a direct replacement for the `notifier.smtp.trusted_cert`, instead
of being the path to a specific file it is a path to a directory containing certificates trusted by Authelia. This
affects other services like LDAP as well.

| Previous Key |  New Key  |
