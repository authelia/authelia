The Authelia team consists of 3 globally distributed developers working actively on improving Authelia in our spare time
and we define our priorities based on a roadmap that we share here for transparency. We also try to balance features and
improvements as much as possible with the maintenance tasks we have to perform to keep the backlog of open issues in a
reasonable state. If you're willing to contribute and help us move forward faster, get in touch with us on Matrix. We'll
be glad to share ideas and plans with you.

It's important to note that the versions listed on a roadmap item unless noted as completed are an intended estimation.
Plans may change and we may potentially forget to update the version. If you feel we've forgotten please feel free to
let us know via a GitHub Discussion or one of the Chat options.
