We have decided to implement [OAuth 2.0] and [OpenID Connect 1.0] as a beta feature. While it's relatively stable there
may inevitably be the occasional breaking change as we carefully implement each aspect of the relevant specifications.
It's suggested to use a bit more caution with this feature than most features, we do however greatly appreciate your
feedback. [OpenID Connect 1.0] and it's related endpoints are not enabled by default unless you explicitly configure the
[OpenID Connect 1.0 Provider Configuration] and [OpenID Connect 1.0 Registered Clients] sections.

As [OpenID Connect 1.0] is fairly complex (the [OpenID Connect 1.0] Provider role especially so) it's intentional that
it is both a beta and that the implemented features are part of a thoughtful roadmap. Items that are not immediately
obvious as required (i.e. bug fixes or spec features), will likely be discussed in team meetings or on GitHub issues
before being added to the list. We want to implement this feature in a very thoughtful way in order to avoid security
issues.

## Stages

This section represents the stages involved in implementation of this feature. The stages are either in order of
implementation due to there being an underlying requirement to implement them in this order, or in a rough order due to
how important or difficult to implement they are.

  * Tokens
  * Auditable Information
