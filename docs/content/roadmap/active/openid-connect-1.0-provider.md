We have decided to implement [OAuth 2.0] and [OpenID Connect 1.0] as a beta feature. While it's relatively stable there
may inevitably be the occasional breaking change as we carefully implement each aspect of the relevant specifications.
It's suggested to use a bit more caution with this feature than most features, we do however greatly appreciate your
feedback. [OpenID Connect 1.0] and it's related endpoints are not enabled by default unless you explicitly configure the
[OpenID Connect 1.0 Provider Configuration] and [OpenID Connect 1.0 Registered Clients] sections.

As [OpenID Connect 1.0] is fairly complex (the [OpenID Connect 1.0] Provider role especially so) it's intentional that
it is both a beta and that the implemented features are part of a thoughtful roadmap. Items that are not immediately
obvious as required (i.e. bug fixes or spec features), will likely be discussed in team meetings or on GitHub issues
before being added to the list. We want to implement this feature in a very thoughtful way in order to avoid security
issues.

## OpenID Certified™

Authelia is [OpenID Certified™] to conform to the [OpenID Connect™ protocol].

[Integration Documentation](../../integration/openid-connect/introduction.md#openid-certified).

### General Availability

{{< roadmap-status >}}

This stage will signify official stability guarantees surrounding this implemented feature.

### Miscellaneous

This stage lists features which individually do not fit into a specific stage and may or may not be implemented.

#### Multi-Issuer Configuration

{{< callout context="danger" title="Important Notes" icon="outline/alert-octagon" >}}
This will be a planned breaking-change as per our
[Versioning Policy](../../policies/versioning.md#experimental-features).
{{< /callout >}}

The initial design of our [OpenID Connect 1.0] implementation was before
[Multi-Domain Protection](multi-domain-protection.md) was considered. It's important for the future of Authelia that we
carefully consider the implications of this and force users to configure a issuer per domain they wish to serve
[OpenID Connect 1.0] from and each of these are completely separate logical units.

various jurisdictions. While we're not expressly targeting these financial institutions the security profile itself
has many security-enhancing measures which everyone can benefit from.

See the [OpenID Connect 1.0] website for the [FAPI 2.0 Security Profile] specification, and the
[FAPI 2.0 Attacker Model].

#### End-User Scope Grants

{{< roadmap-status >}}

Allow users to choose which scopes they grant. It may be better to just allow optional claims and to avoid implementing
this feature all together.

#### Client RBAC: Users and Groups

{{< roadmap-status stage="complete" version="v4.38.0" >}}

See also [Beta 6](#beta-6) and [Client RBAC: Networks](#client-rbac-networks).

Allow the creation of custom authorization policies for [OpenID Connect 1.0]. Allow the policies to contain either users
or groups and an effective authorization policy applied to them from either `one_factor`, `two_factor`, or `deny`.

Allow these policies to be configured on one or more clients.

#### Client RBAC: Networks

{{< roadmap-status stage="complete" version="v4.39.0" >}}

See also [Beta 7](#beta-7) and [Client RBAC: Users and Groups](#client-rbac-users-and-groups).

Allow enhancing the existing custom authorization policies to include networks.

#### Preferred Username Claim

{{< roadmap-status stage="complete" version="v4.33.2" >}}

The `preferred_username` claim was missing and was fixed.
