Contributions to __Authelia__ have four main forms:

* Utilizing GitHub [Issues] or [Discussions] to make commentary about bugs, ideas, etc.
* [Development](../development/introduction.md)
* [Documentation](documentation-contributions.md)
* [Financial](financial.md)

We encourage our community to be part of __Authelia__ by contributing in these ways. We encourage anyone who wishes to
contribute via development to utilize GitHub [Issues] or [Discussions] or one of the
[other contact methods](../../overview/project/contact.md) to discuss their contribution in advance and come up with a design
plan.
