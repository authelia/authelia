The way the translation process is facilitated is via [Crowdin]. We encourage members of the community to
[join the Authelia Crowdin project](https://translate.authelia.com) and help translate their preferred language.

## New Languages

If the language you wish to translate is not on [Crowdin] then you have a few options:

1. Ask for the language to be added via the [Crowdin] interface.
2. Ask a maintainer to add it via one of the [contact options](../../information/contact.md).
3. Make a pull request directly on GitHub modifying the translation files within
[this directory](https://github.com/authelia/authelia/tree/master/internal/server/locales).

## Overrides

Users can override translations easily locally using the
[assets](../../configuration/miscellaneous/server.md#asset_path) directory. This is useful if you wish to perform a
translation and see if it looks correct in the browser.
