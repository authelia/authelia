## authelia access-control check-policy

Checks a request against the access control rules to determine what policy would be applied

### Synopsis


Checks a request against the access control rules to determine what policy would be applied.

Legend:

	#		The rule position in the configuration.
	*		The first fully matched rule.
	~		Potential match i.e. if the user was authenticated they may match this rule.
	hit     The criteria in this column is a match to the request.
	miss    The criteria in this column is not match to the request.
	may     The criteria in this column is potentially a match to the request.

Notes:

	A rule that potentially matches a request will cause a redirection to occur in order to perform one-factor
	authentication. This is so Authelia can adequately determine if the rule actually matches.
