## Recommended Configurations

When we introduced WebAuthn the configuration was incredibly basic. As time has progressed we've added a lot of
security and trust focused options so we can leverage the technology available more. This section contains various
recommended configurations.

### Passkeys

The following is a configuration that's compliant with NIST recommendations.

```yaml
# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://www.authelia.com/schemas/latest/json-schema/configuration.json
webauthn:
  enable_passkey_login: true
  attestation_conveyance_preference: 'direct'
  filtering:
    prohibit_backup_eligibility: true
  metadata:
    enabled: true
    validate_trust_anchor: true
    validate_entry: true
    validate_status: true
    validate_entry_permit_zero_aaguid: false
```

## Metadata Status

Some areas of the configuration allow filtering devices based on the metadata status. This serves as a list of these
status values.

This means that the authenticator could be used without the user’s consent and potentially even without the user’s knowledge.                                                                                                                  |
|  `ATTESTATION_KEY_COMPROMISE`  | Security: Indicates that an attestation key for this authenticator is known to be compromised. The relying party SHOULD check the certificate field and use it to identify the compromised authenticator batch. If the certificate field is not set, the relying party should reject all new registrations of the compromised authenticator. The Authenticator manufacturer should set the date to the date when compromise has occurred. |

This would include both, e.g. weak entropy that causes predictable keys to be generated or side channels that allow keys or signatures to be forged, guessed or extracted.                                                                 |

For example if it is known to be a fraudulent product or contain a deliberate backdoor. Relying parties SHOULD reject any future registration of this authenticator model.                                                                                 |

If this completed checklist is publicly available, the URL will be specified in url.                                                                                                                      |
