This guide effectively documents the usage of the
[asset_path](../../configuration/miscellaneous/server.md#asset_path) server configuration option.

## Structure

## locales

Currently users can only override languages that already exist in this list either by overriding
the language itself, or adding a variant form of that language. If you'd like support for another language feel free
to make a PR. We also encourage people to make PR's for variants where the difference in the variants is significant.

Users wishing to override the locales files should be aware that we do not provide any guarantee
that the file will not change in a breaking way between releases as per our [Versioning Policy]. Users who planning to
utilize these overrides should either check for changes to the files in the
[en](https://github.com/authelia/authelia/tree/master/internal/server/locales/en) translation prior to upgrading or
[Contribute](../../contributing/prologue/translations.md) their translation to ensure it is maintained.

The locales directory holds folders of internationalization locales. This directory can be utilized to override these
locales. They are the names of locales that are returned by the `navigator.language` ECMAScript command. These are
generally those in the [RFC5646 / BCP47 Format](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5646) specifically the language
codes from [Crowdin](https://support.crowdin.com/api/language-codes/).

Each directory has JSON files which you can explore the format of in the
[internal/server/locales](https://github.com/authelia/authelia/tree/master/internal/server/locales) directory on
GitHub. The important part is the key names you wish to override.

A full example for the `en-US` locale for the portal namespace is `locales/en-US/portal.json`.

Languages in browsers are supported in two forms. In their language only form such as `en` for English, and in their
variant form such as `en-AU` for English (Australian). If a user has the browser language `en-AU` we automatically load
the `en` and `en-AU` languages, where any keys in the `en-AU` language take precedence over the `en` language, and the
translations for the `en` language only applying when a translation from `en-AU` is not available.

### Namespaces

Each file in a locale directory represents a translation namespace. The list of current namespaces are below:

| Namespace |       Purpose       |
|:---------:|:-------------------:|
|  portal   | Portal Translations |

### Supported Languages
