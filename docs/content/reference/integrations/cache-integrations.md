We currently only support [Redis Standalone] and [Redis Sentinel] for cached information like sessions
(other than in-memory).

## Redis

The following is guidance on versions of [Redis] supported.

### Standalone

When it comes to [Redis Standalone] we support the versions supported by [Redis] themselves which can be found in the
[Redis release cycle](https://redis.io/docs/about/releases/) documentation. This is typically the latest available
version.


### Sentinel

When it comes to [Redis Sentinel] we support the versions supported by [Redis] themselves which can be found in the
[Redis release cycle](https://redis.io/docs/about/releases/) documentation. This is typically the latest available
version.

Currently we only support [Redis Sentinel](https://redis.io/docs/management/sentinel/) version 6.x due to a breaking
change to [Redis Sentinel](https://redis.io/docs/management/sentinel/) in version 7.x. This will be resolved in the near
future.
