The __Authelia__ team aims to abide by the [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) policy. This
means that we use the format `<major>.<minor>.<patch>` for our version numbers, where a change to `major` denotes a
breaking change which will likely require user interaction to upgrade, `minor` which denotes a new feature, and `patch`
denotes a fix.

It is therefore recommended users do not automatically upgrade the `minor` version without reading the patch notes, and
it's critically important users do not upgrade the `major` version without reading the patch notes. You should pin your
version to `4.37` for example to prevent automatic upgrades of the `minor` version, or pin your version to `4` to
prevent automatic upgrade of the `major` version.

We generally do not recommend automated upgrades of critical systems but instead recommend ensuring you are notified an
upgrade exists.

## Important Notes

1. While we make every effort to ensure zero breaking changes occur, this versioning policy **_does not_** cover the
   following at this time:
   1. Changes between stable releases. i.e. changes to `master`, alpha, beta, pre-release, or any other testing build.
   2. The notable [exceptions](#exceptions).
2. Examples (i.e. it's not limited to these examples) of the changes which may occur between stable releases are:
   - Features may be removed.
   - The method of configuring unreleased features may change. i.e. configuration keys may change, or additional keys
     may be required to enable a feature.
3. Significant manual changes may be required to gain access to new features depending on their implementation and
   complexity. This however does not mean existing functionality is intended to break, just new functionality may be
   unavailable without manual intervention.
4. There may be deprecations in `minor` or `patch` releases. This however **_does not_** mean that you can't continue to
   use the deprecated item, it just means it's discouraged as it **_does_** mean that it's likely in the next `major`
   release it will be completely removed. This applies but is not limited to:
   - Features.
   - Configuration Keys.

## Supported Versions

The following information is indicative of our support policy:

- We provide support to user questions for 3 `minor` versions at minimum
- We provide bug fixes (as a `patch`) to the latest `minor` version
- We provide vulnerability fixes:
  - As workarounds in the [security advisory](https://github.com/authelia/authelia/security/advisories) (if possible)
  - As patches in the [security advisory](https://github.com/authelia/authelia/security/advisories)
  - To the last 3 `minor` versions upon request

## Major Version Zero

A major version of `v0.x.x` indicates as per the [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) policy
that there may be breaking changes without warning. Some [components](#components) will be released under this version
while they're in early development.

## Components

Several components may exist at various times. We aim to abide by this policy for all components related to Authelia.
It is important to note that each component has its own version, for example the primary Authelia binary version may be
v4.40.0 but another component such as the [Helm Chart](https://charts.authelia.com) version may be v0.9.0.

This means that a breaking change may occur to one but not the other as these components do not share a version.

## Exceptions

There are exceptions to this versioning policy and this section details these exceptions. It should be noted while there
may be breaking changes in these exception areas we generally avoid making them where possible.

### Advanced Customizations

Some advanced customizations are not guaranteed by the versioning policy. These features require the administrator to
ensure they keep up to date with the changes relevant to their version. While the customizations exist as a feature we
cannot allow these customizations to hinder the development process.

Notable Advanced Customizations:

- Templates:
  - Email
  - Content Security Policy header
- Localization / Internationalization Assets

### Experimental Features

Features which are described in a way which indicates they are not ready for use do not have the same guarantees under
this versioning policy. The reasoning is as we develop these features there may be mistakes and/or uncertainty about a
particular feature (i.e. the feature may be problematic due to its nature) and we may need to make a change that would
normally be considered a breaking change. As these features graduate from their status to generally available they will
move into our standard versioning policy and lose their exception status.

This exception applies to all features which are described as:

- beta
- experimental

Notable examples:

- [OpenID Connect 1.0](../configuration/identity-providers/openid-connect/provider.md)
- [File Filters](../configuration/methods/files.md#file-filters)
