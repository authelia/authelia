## What is Authelia?

Authelia is a project with several open source developers who contribute to the project in their free time. We are not
a company or another type of incorporated entity, and do not have any monetization model. Individuals and Organizations
are free to contribute [financially](../contributing/prologue/financial.md) or with their time to the
[documentation](../contributing/prologue/documentation-contributions.md) or
[code base](../contributing/development/introduction.md).

## Sponsors

Authelia is sponsored by the organizations listed below. The organizations below sponsor us completely voluntarily
and do not expect anything additional other than us mentioning them or having a code of conduct, and some do not even
require either of those things.

Please see the [sponsorship section](../contributing/prologue/financial.md#sponsorship) of the financial contributing
page for more information on how to become a sponsor.

### Balto

Our [apt repository](https://apt.authelia.com) was previously hosted thanks to Balto. We now host it ourselves on
[Netlify](#netlify) due to the unfortunate fact that Balto has shut down. We graciously want to thank Balto for their
support of and generosity towards the Authelia project.
