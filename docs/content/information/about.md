## What is Authelia?

{{< sitevar name="domain" nojs="example.com" >}}

Authelia is a project with several open source developers who contribute to the project in their free time. We are not
a company or another type of incorporated entity, and do not have any monetization model. Individuals and Organizations
are free to contribute [financially](../contributing/prologue/financial.md) or with their time to the
[documentation](../contributing/prologue/documentation-contributions.md) or
[code base](../contributing/development/introduction.md).
