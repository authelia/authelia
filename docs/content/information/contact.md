### Discussions

The [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/authelia/authelia/discussions) forum is the correct location to discuss
anything that is not a bug or feature request such as:

- Ideas about future features where it's not clear most people can use it (allows users to vote on it)
- Questions / Support Requests
- Sharing configuration or utilization ideas (i.e. show your setup) for things that are not obvious
- Any issue you're experiencing that may or may not be a bug (i.e you're unsure if it's a bug)

### Issues

If you have found a bug or have a feature request please visit
[GitHub Issues](https://github.com/authelia/authelia/issues) and once you've checked an existing bug or feature request
has not been lodged feel free to lodge your own.

integration. If you are having an issue with one of these areas please utilize [discussions](#discussions) or one of
