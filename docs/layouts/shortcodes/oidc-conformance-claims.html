      <p>Additional Configuration Required: Claims Conformance</p>
    </div>
    <div class="callout-body">
      <p>For the reasons noted below; in addition to the configuration example you will likely have to configure a claims
        policy and assign that policy to the client in order to get the expected claims into the ID Token which is
        described and documented
        <a href="/integration/openid-connect/openid-connect-1.0-claims/#restore-functionality-prior-to-claims-parameter">here</a>.
      </p>
      {{- with .Get "claims" }}
      {{- $claims := split . "," }}
      <p>
        The known claims required in the ID Token for this client are
        {{- range $i, $claim := $claims }}
        {{- if eq $i 0 }}
        <code>{{ $claim }}</code>
        {{- else -}}
        ,
        {{- if eq (add 1 $i) (len $claims) }}
        and
        {{- end }}
        <code>{{ $claim }}</code>
        {{- end -}}
        {{- end -}}
        .
      </p>
      {{- end }}
      <p>Authelia has adopted a claims hydration architecture that is conformant with the
        <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html" target="_blank">OpenID Connect 1.0</a>
        specification. Clients are required to operate under the assumption that claims requested by scope values are
        available by using the Access Token (the scope is granted and issued to the Access Token) at the UserInfo
        Endpoint as described by
        <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#ScopeClaims" target="_blank">5.4. Requesting Claims using Scope Values</a>
        with the exception of an Implicit Flow that does not return an Access Token, or explicitly request them via the
        claims parameter as described by
        <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#ClaimsParameter" target="_blank">5.5. Requesting Claims using the "claims" Request Parameter</a> .
      </p>
      <p>
        At the time of this writing this client did not support this, and very likely also ignores the
        <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#ClaimStability" target="_blank">claims stability warning</a>
        which requires clients to anchor accounts via the <code>sub</code> and <code>iss</code> claims. Both of these
        elements are clear indications the client does not properly support
        <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html" target="_blank">OpenID Connect 1.0</a> and is not conformant.</p>
