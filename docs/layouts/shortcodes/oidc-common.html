      <p>
        Unfortunately at the time this guide was last modified (noted at the bottom of the guide) this third-party
        application has bugs which are significant and indicate either a fairly low level of support for
        <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html" target="_blank">OpenID Connect 1.0</a> or no
        effective support at all. This guide may have workarounds to adapt to this but this is done solely on a best
        effort basis. The developers of the application should be encouraged to fix these bugs.

        <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html" target="_blank">OpenID Connect 1.0</a> as it
        does not honor the expected process to retrieve the claims it needs to access. The workaround is documented in

      <p>
        <b><i>Client Credentials Encoding:</i></b> this client does not properly encode the client credentials before
        using them for authentication as per
        <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749#appendix-B" target="_blank">RFC6749 Appendix B</a>. It is
        required that the Client ID and Client Secret are both URL Escaped before being used for both the
        <code>client_secret_post</code> and <code>client_secret_basic</code> authentication mechanisms. Avoiding special
        characters in both the Client ID and Client Secret or URL Escaping them before adding them to the clients
        configuration are the only workarounds. Authelia's random password generator will automatically output both
        a normal version and a pre-encoded version which you could utilize.

        <b><i>Claim Binding:</i></b> this client outright does not support
        <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html" target="_blank">OpenID Connect 1.0</a> as it
        does not bind the identity provider identity (the <code>sub</code> and <code>iss</code> claims which are
        guaranteed not to change) to local accounts, instead it uses claims like <code>email</code> and
        <code>preferred_username</code> which is a vulnerability that could result in a simple privilege escalation. The
        developer has been made aware of this vulnerability but has decided not to fix it. See
        <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#ClaimStability" target="_blank">Connect 1.0 Section 5.7 Claim Stability and Uniqueness</a>

### Common Notes

1. The [OpenID Connect 1.0](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html) `client_id` parameter:
    1. This *__must__* be a unique value for every client.
    2. The value used in this guide is merely for readability and demonstration purposes and you *__should not__* use
       this value in production and should instead utilize the [How do I generate a client identifier or client secret?]({{ $faq }}#how-do-i-generate-a-client-identifier-or-client-secret)
       FAQ. We recommend 64 random characters but you can use any arbitrary value that meets the other criteria.
    3. This *__must__* only contain [RFC3986 Unreserved Characters](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3986#section-2.3).
    4. This *__must__* be no more than 100 characters in length.
2. The [OpenID Connect 1.0](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html) `client_secret` parameter:
    1. The value used in this guide is merely for demonstration purposes and you *__should absolutely not__* use this
       value in production and should instead utilize the
       [How do I generate a client identifier or client secret?]({{ $faq }}#how-do-i-generate-a-client-identifier-or-client-secret) FAQ.
    2. This string may be stored as plaintext in the Authelia configuration but this behaviour is deprecated and is not
       guaranteed to be supported in the future. See the [Plaintext]({{ $faq }}#plaintext) guide for more
       information.
    3. When the secret is stored in hashed form in the Authelia configuration (*__heavily recommended__*), the cost of
       hashing can, if too great, cause timeouts for clients. See the
       [Tuning the work factors]({{ $faq }}#tuning-work-factors) guide for more information.
3. The configuration example for Authelia:
    1. Only contains an example configuration for the client registration and you *__MUST__* also configure the required
       elements from the [OpenID Connect 1.0 Provider Configuration]({{ printf "%s/provider/" $config }}) guide.
    2. Only contains a small portion of all of the available options for a registered client and users may wish to
       configure portions that are not part of this guide or configure them differently, as such it's important to
       both familiarize yourself with the other options available and the effect of each of the options configured in
       this section by looking at the [OpenID Connect 1.0 Clients Configuration]({{ printf "%s/clients/" $config }})
       guide.
