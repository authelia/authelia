        <h2 class="h4">Lightweight 🪶</h2>
        <p>With a compressed container size smaller than 20 megabytes and observed memory usage normally under 30 megabytes, it's one of the most lightweight solutions available.</p>

        <h2 class="h4">Blazing Fast ⚡</h2>
        <p>Written in <a href="https://golang.org/" target="_blank">Go</a> and <a href="https://reactjs.org/" target="_blank">React</a>, authorization policies and many other backend tasks are completed in mere milliseconds and login portal loading times of 100 milliseconds makes it one of the fastest solutions available.</p>

        <h2 class="h4">Efficient ♻</h2>
        <p>Processors can use a lot of electricity, but when idle usage is basically so low that you can't measure it, and active usage in a small business environment being under 1% you can rest easy (with the exclusion of password hashing).</p>
