# Default redirection URL
#
# If user tries to authenticate without any referer, Authelia
# does not know where to redirect the user to at the end of the
# authentication process.
# This parameter allows you to specify the default redirection
# URL Authelia will use in such a case.
#
# Note: this parameter is optional. If not provided, user won't
# be redirected upon successful authentication.

# The authentication backend to use for verifying user passwords
# and retrieve information such as email address and groups
# users belong to.
#
# There are two supported backends: `ldap` and `file`.
authentication_backend:
  # LDAP backend configuration.
  #
  # This backend allows Authelia to be scaled to more
  # than one instance and therefore is recommended for
  # production.
  ldap:
    # The url of the ldap server
    url: ldap://ldap-service
  
    # The base dn for every entries
    base_dn: dc=example,dc=com

    additional_users_dn: ou=users
  
    # The users filter used to find the user DN
    # {0} is a matcher replaced by username.
    # 'cn={0}' by default.
    users_filter: cn={0}
  
    # An additional dn to define the scope of groups
    additional_groups_dn: ou=groups
  
    # The groups filter used for retrieving groups of a given user.
    # {0} is a matcher replaced by username.
    # {dn} is a matcher replaced by user DN.
    # {uid} is a matcher replaced by user uid.
    # 'member={dn}' by default.

    password: password

  # File backend configuration.
  #
  # With this backend, the users database is stored in a file
  # which is updated when users reset their passwords.
  # Therefore, this backend is meant to be used in a dev environment
  # and not in production since it prevents Authelia to be scaled to
  # more than one instance.
