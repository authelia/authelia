Additionally you can use this policy to conditionally deny access in desired situations. Examples include denying access to an API that has no authentication mechanism built in. bypass . This policy skips all authentication and allows anyone to use the resource. This policy is not available with a rule that includes a subject restriction because the minimum authentication level required to obtain information about the subject is one_factor. one_factor . This policy requires the user at minimum complete 1FA successfully (username and password). This means if they have performed 2FA then they will be allowed to access the resource. two_factor .

    "title": "Rules",
    "content": "A rule defines two things: . | the matching criteria of the request presented to the reverse proxy | the policy applied when all criteria match. | . The criteria are: . | domain: domain or list of domains targeted by the request. | resources: pattern or list of patterns that the path should match. | subject: the user or group of users to define the policy for. | networks: the network addresses, ranges (CIDR notation) or groups from where the request originates. | methods: the http methods used in the request. | . A rule is matched when all criteria of the rule match. Rules are evaluated in sequential order, and this is particularly important for bypass rules. Bypass rules should generally appear near the top of the rules list. Policy . A policy represents the level of authentication the user needs to pass before being authorized to request the resource. See Policies for more information. Domains . The domains defined in rules must obviously be either a subdomain of the domain protected by Authelia or the protected domain itself. In order to match multiple subdomains, the wildcard matcher character *. can be used as prefix of the domain. For instance, to define a rule for all subdomains of example.com, one would use *.example.com in the rule. A single rule can define multiple domains for matching. These domains can be either listed in YAML-short form [\"example1.com\", \"example2.com\"] or in YAML long-form as dashed list. Domain prefixes can also be dynamically match users or groups. For example you can have a specific policy adjustment if the user or group matches the subdomain. For example {user}.example.com or {group}.example.com check the users name or groups against the subdomain. Resources . A rule can define multiple regular expressions for matching the path of the resource similar to the list of domains. If any one of them matches, the resource criteria of the rule matches. Note that regular expressions can be used to match a given path. However prior to 4.27.0, they do not match the query parameters in the URL, only the path. If you’re upgrading to 4.27.0+ you may have to alter some resource rules to get them to work as they previously did. You might also face some escaping issues preventing Authelia to start. Please make sure that when you are using regular expressions, you enclose them between quotes. It’s optional but it will likely save you a lot of debugging time. Subjects . A subject is a representation of a user or a group of user for who the rule should apply. For a user with unique identifier john, the subject should be user:john and for a group uniquely identified by developers, the subject should be group:developers. Similar to resources and domains you can define multiple subjects in a single rule. If you want a combination of subjects to be matched at once using a logical AND, you can specify a nested list of subjects like - [\"group:developers\", \"group:admins\"]. In summary, the first list level of subjects are evaluated using a logical OR, whereas the second level by a logical AND. The last example below reads as: the group is dev AND the username is john OR the group is admins. Combining subjects and the bypass policy . A subject cannot be combined with the bypass policy since the minimum authentication level to identify a subject is one_factor. Combining the one_factor policy with a subject is effectively the same as setting the policy to bypass in the past. We have taken an opinionated stance on preventing this configuration as it could result in problematic security scenarios with badly thought out configurations and cannot see a likely configuration scenario that would require users to do this. If you have a scenario in mind please open an issue on GitHub. Networks . A list of network addresses, ranges (CIDR notation) or groups can be specified in a rule in order to apply different policies when requests originate from different networks. This list can contain both literal definitions of networks and network aliases. Network addresses specified will be matched against the first IP in the X-Forwarded-For, and if there is none it will fall back to the IP address of the request. If using Authelia with a reverse proxy, additional configuration may be required on the reverse proxy to ensure these headers are present and correct. Main use cases for this rule option is to adjust the security requirements of a resource based on the location of the user. For example lets say a resource should be exposed both on the Internet and from an authenticated VPN for instance. Passing a second factor a first time to get access to the VPN and a second time to get access to the application can sometimes be cumbersome if the endpoint is not considered overly sensitive. An additional situation where this may be useful is if there is a specific network you wish to deny access or require a higher level of authentication for; like a public machine network vs a company device network, or a BYOD network. Even if Authelia provides this flexibility, you might prefer a higher level of security and avoid this option entirely. You and only you can define your security policy and it’s up to you to configure Authelia accordingly. Methods . A list of HTTP request methods to apply the rule to. Valid values are GET, HEAD, POST, PUT, DELETE, CONNECT, OPTIONS, and TRACE. Additional information about HTTP request methods can be found on the MDN. It’s important to note this policy type is primarily intended for use when you wish to bypass authentication for a specific request method. This is because there are several key limitations in what is possible to accomplish without Authelia being a reverse proxy server. This rule type is discouraged unless you really know what you’re doing or you wish to setup a rule to bypass CORS preflight requests by bypassing for the OPTIONS method. For example, if you require authentication only for write events (POST, PATCH, DELETE, PUT), when a user who is not currently authenticated tries to do one of these actions, they will be redirected to Authelia. Authelia will decide what level is required for authentication, and then after the user authenticates it will redirect them to the original URL where Authelia decided they needed to authenticate. So if the endpoint they are redirected to originally had data sent as part of the request, this data is completely lost. Further if the endpoint expects the data or doesn’t allow GET request types, the user may be presented with an error leading to a bad user experience. ",

Note that Authelia is hot-reloaded in the environment so that your patches are instantly included. The next command starts the suite called Standalone: . $ authelia-scripts suites setup Standalone .

For example if you wanted to improve the entropy you could generate a 16 byte salt and provide it with the --salt flag. Example: authelia hash-password --salt abcdefghijklhijl. For argon2id the salt must always be valid for base64 decoding (characters a through z, A through Z, 0 through 9, and +/). Passwords passed to hash-password should be single quoted if using special characters to prevent parameter substitution. For instance to generate a hash with the docker image just run: . $ docker run authelia/authelia:latest authelia hash-password 'yourpassword' Password hash: $argon2id$v=19$m=65536$3oc26byQuSkQqksq$zM1QiTvVPrMfV6BVLs2t4gM+af5IN7euO0VB6+Q8ZFs .

Password hash algorithm . The default hash algorithm is Argon2id version 19 with a salt. Argon2id is currently considered the best hashing algorithm, and in 2015 won the Password Hashing Competition. It benefits from customizable parameters allowing the cost of computing a hash to scale into the future which makes it harder to brute-force. Argon2id was implemented due to community feedback as you can see in this closed issue. For backwards compatibility and user choice support for the SHA512 algorithm is still available. While it’s a reasonable hashing function given high enough iterations, as hardware improves it has a higher chance of being brute-forced. Hashes are identifiable as argon2id or SHA512 by their prefix of either $argon2id$ and $6$ respectively, as described in this wiki page. Important Note: When using argon2id Authelia will appear to remain using the memory allocated to creating the hash. This is due to how Go allocates memory to the heap when generating an argon2id hash. Go periodically garbage collects the heap, however this doesn’t remove the memory allocation, it keeps it allocated even though it’s technically unused. Under memory pressure the unused allocated memory will be reclaimed by the operating system, you can test this on linux with: . $ stress-ng --vm-bytes $(awk '/MemFree/{printf \"%d\\n\", $2 * 0.9;}' &lt; /proc/meminfo)k --vm-keep -m 1 . If this is not desirable we recommend investigating the following options in order of most to least secure: . | using the LDAP authentication provider | adjusting the memory parameter | changing the algorithm | . Password hash algorithm tuning . All algorithm tuning for Argon2id is supported. The only configuration variables that affect SHA512 are iterations and salt length. The configuration variables are unique to the file authentication provider, thus they all exist in a key under the file authentication configuration key called password. We have set what are considered as sane and recommended defaults to cater for a reasonable system, if you’re unsure about which settings to tune, please see the parameters below, or for a more in depth understanding see the referenced documentation in Argon2 links. Examples for specific systems . These examples have been tested against a single system to make sure they roughly take 0.5 seconds each. Your results may vary depending on individual specification and utilization, but they are a good guide to get started.

    "content": "The only way Authelia can share information about the authenticated user currently is through the use of four HTTP headers: Remote-User, Remote-Name, Remote-Email and Remote-Groups. Those headers are returned by Authelia on requests to /api/verify and must be forwarded by the reverse proxy to the backends needing them. The headers will be provided with each call to the backend once the user is authenticated. Please note that the backend must support the use of those headers to leverage that information, many backends still don’t (and probably won’t) support it. However, we are working on solving this issue with OpenID Connect/OAuth2 which is a widely adopted open standard for access delegation. So, if you’re developing your own application, you can read those headers and use them. If you don’t own the codebase of the backend, you need to check whether it supports this type of authentication or not. If it does not, you have three options: . | Enable authentication on the backend and make your users authenticate twice (not user-friendly). | Completely disable the authentication of your backend. This works only if all your users share the same privileges in the backend. | Many applications support OAuth2 so the last option would be to just wait for Authelia to be an OpenID Connect provider (https://github.com/authelia/authelia/issues/189). | .

Secondly Authelia uses salting with all hashing algorithms. These salts are generated with a random string generator, which is seeded every time it’s used by a cryptographically secure 1024bit prime number. This ensures that even if an attacker obtains the file, each password has to be brute forced individually. Lastly Authelia’s implementation of Argon2id is highly tunable. You can tune the key length, salt used, iterations (time), parallelism, and memory usage. To read more about this please read how to configure file authentication. ",

As such all connections require the following: . | TLS Connection (STARTTLS or SMTPS) has been negotiated before authentication or sending emails (unauthenticated connections require it as well) | Valid X509 Certificate presented to the client during the TLS handshake | . There is an option to disable both of these security measures however they are not recommended. You should only do this in a situation where you control all networks between Authelia and the SMTP server. The following configuration options exist to configure the security level: . SMTPS vs STARTTLS . By default all connections start as plain text and are upgraded via STARTTLS. SMTPS is supported, however due to the fact it was basically considered deprecated before the turn of the century, there is no way to configure it. It happens automatically when a SMTP notifier is configured with the SMTPS port of 465. Configuration Option: disable_verify_cert . This is a YAML boolean type (true/false, y/n, 1/0, etc). This disables the X509 PKI verification mechanism. We recommend using the trusted_cert option over this, as disabling this security feature makes you vulnerable to MITM attacks. Configuration Option: disable_require_tls . This is a YAML boolean type (true/false, y/n, 1/0, etc). This disables the requirement that all connections must be over TLS. This is only usable currently with authentication disabled (comment the password) and as such is only an option for SMTP servers that allow unauthenticated relay (bad practice). Configuration Option: trusted_cert . This is a YAML string type. This specifies the file location of a pub certificate that can be used to validate the authenticity of a server with a self signed certificate. This can either be the public cert of the certificate authority used to sign the certificate or the public key itself. They must be in the PEM format. The certificate is added in addition to the certificates trusted by the host machine. If the certificate is invalid, inaccessible, or is otherwise not configured; Authelia just uses the hosts certificates. Explanation . There are a few reasons for the security measures implemented: . | Transmitting username’s and passwords over plain-text is an obvious vulnerability | The emails generated by Authelia, if transmitted in plain-text could allow an attacker to intercept a link used to setup 2FA; which reduces security | Not validating the identity of the server allows man-in-the-middle attacks | .

This is used to encrypt the session data when when stored in the Redis key value database. This should be as random as possible. Additionally you can configure the validity period of sessions. For example in a highly security conscious domain you would probably want to set the session remember_me_duration to 0 to disable this feature, and set an expiration of something like 2 hours and inactivity of 10 minutes. This means the hard limit or the time the session will be destroyed no matter what is 2 hours, and the soft limit or the time a user can be inactive for is 10 minutes.

We also try to balance features and improvements as much as possible with the maintenance tasks we have to perform to keep the backlog of open issues in a reasonable state. If you’re willing to contribute and help us move forward faster, get in touch with us on Matrix. We’ll be glad to share ideas and plans with you. Below are the prioritised roadmap items: . | Authelia acts as an OpenID Connect Provider. This is a high priority because currently the only way to pass authentication information back to the protected app is through the use of HTTP headers as described here however, many apps either do not support this method or are starting to move away from this in favour of OpenID Connect or OAuth2 internally or via plugins. | Administration interface. This is useful in many cases to properly manage users and administrate activities like unbanning banned users. In the future we can even think of adding/removing users from there, request a password reset for a user or all users, request a 2FA enrollment, temporarily block users, etc… . | User interface. This will help the users manage their 2FA devices, reset their password, review their authentication activity. In the future we envisage users will be able to customize their profile with an avatar, set their preferences regarding 2FA and according to the global policy defined by administrators, etc… . | Facilitate setup on Kubernetes. There are mainly two objectives here. First, we need to provide the documentation required to setup Authelia on Kubernetes. Even though, some users already have it working and the feature is even tested in the project, there is a clear lack of documentation. The second item is to provide a Helm chart to streamline the setup on Kubernetes. | . ",

    "content": "There are some components within Authelia that may optionally be made stateful by using certain providers. Examples of this are as follows: . Session Provider . Severity: BREAKING. Solution: Use a session provider other than memory (Redis). If you do not configure an external provider for the session configuration it stores the session in memory. This is unacceptable for the operation of Authelia and is thus not supported for high availability. Storage Provider . Severity: BREAKING. Solution: Use a session provider other than SQLite3 (MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL). Use of the local storage provider (SQLite3) is not supported in high availability setups due to a design limitation with how SQLite3 operates. Use any of the other storage providers. Notification Provider . Severity: HIGH. Solution: Use a notification provider other than file system (SMTP). Use of the file system notification provider prevents users from several key tasks which heavily impact usability of the system, and technically reduce security. Users will be unable to reset passwords or register new 2FA devices on their own. The file system provider is not supported for high availability. Authentication Provider . Severity: MEDIUM (limiting). Solution: Use an authentication provider other than file (LDAP), or distribute the file and disable password reset. Use of the file authentication provider (YAML) is only partially supported with high availability setups. It’s recommended if you don’t use a stateless provider that you disable password reset and make sure the file is distributed to all instances. We do not support using the file type in these scenarios. ",

An email with a link is sent to the user and a click is required to confirm the action. | Prevention against session fixation by regenerating a new session after each privilege elevation. | Prevention against LDAP injection by following OWASP recommendations regarding valid input characters (https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/LDAP_Injection_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html). | Connections between Authelia and thirdparty components like mail server, database, cache and LDAP server can be made over TLS to protect against man-in-the-middle attacks from within the infrastructure. | Validation of user session group memberships gets refreshed regularly from the authentication backend (LDAP only). | .
