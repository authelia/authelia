    "content": "Access Control . Access Control List . With Authelia you can define a list of rules that are going to be evaluated in order when authorization is delegated to Authelia. . The first matching rule of the list defines the policy applied to the resource and, if no rule matches the resource, a customizable default policy is applied. . Access Control Rule . A rule defines two things: . the matching criterion of the request presented to the reverse proxy | the policy applied when all criterion match. | . The criterion are: . domain: domain targeted by the request. | resources: list of patterns that the path should match (one is sufficient). | subject: the user or group of users to define the policy for. | networks: the network range from where should comes the request. | . A rule is matched when all criterion of the rule match . Policies . A policy represents the level of authentication the user needs to pass before being authorized to request the resource. . There exist 4 policies: . bypass: the resource is public as the user does not need any authentication to get access to it. | one_factor: the user needs to pass at least the first factor to get access to the resource. | two_factor: the user needs to pass two factors to get access to the resource. | deny: the user does not have access to the resource. | . Domains . The domains defined in rules must obviously be either a subdomain of the domain protected by Authelia or the protected domain itself. In order to match multiple subdomains, the wildcard matcher character *. can be used as prefix of the domain. For instance, to define a rule for all subdomains of example.com, one would use *.example.com in the rule. . Resources . A rule can define multiple regular expressions for matching the path of the resource. If any one of them matches, the resource criteria of the rule matches. . Subjects . A subject is a representation of a user or a group of user for who the rule should apply. . For a user with unique identifier john, the subject should be user:john and for a group uniquely identified by developers, the subject should be group:developers. Unlike resources there can be only one subject per rule. However, if multiple users or group must be matched by a rule, one can just duplicate the rule as many times as there are subjects. . Note: Any PR to make it a list instead of a single item is welcome. . Networks . A list of network ranges can be specified in a rule in order to apply different policies when requests come from different networks. . The main use case is when, let say a resource should be exposed both on the Internet and from an authenticated VPN for instance. Passing a second factor a first time to get access to the VPN and a second time to get access to the application can sometimes be cumbersome if the endpoint is not that much sensitive. . Even if Authelia provides that flexbility, you might prefer higher level of security and avoid this option entirely. You and only you can define your security policy and it’s up to you to configure Authelia accordingly. . Complete example . Here is a complete example of complex access control list that can be defined in Authelia. . access_control: default_policy: deny rules: - domain: public.example.com policy: bypass - domain: secure.example.com policy: one_factor networks: - 192.168.1.0/24 - domain: secure.example.com policy: two_factor - domain: singlefactor.example.com policy: one_factor - domain: &quot;mx2.mail.example.com&quot; subject: &quot;group:admins&quot; policy: deny - domain: &quot;*.example.com&quot; subject: &quot;group:admins&quot; policy: two_factor - domain: dev.example.com resources: - &quot;^/groups/dev/.*$&quot; subject: &quot;group:dev&quot; policy: two_factor - domain: dev.example.com resources: - &quot;^/users/john/.*$&quot; subject: &quot;user:john&quot; policy: two_factor .",

It can be seen as an extension of those proxies providing authentication functions and a login portal. . As shown in the following architecture diagram, Authelia is directly connected to the reverse proxy but never directly connected to application backends. . . Workflow . Reverse proxies are configured so that every incoming requests generates an authentication request sent to Authelia and to which Authelia responds to order the reverse proxy to let the incoming request pass through or block it because user is not authenticated or is not sufficiently authorized. . Step by step . When the first request of an unauthenticated user hits the reverse proxy, Authelia determines the user is not authenticated because no session cookie has been sent along with the request. Consequently, Authelia redirects the user to the authentication portal provided by Authelia itself. The user can then execute the authentication workflow using that portal to obtain a session cookie valid for all subdomains of the domain protected by Authelia. . When the user visits the initial website again, the query is sent along with the session cookie which is forwarded in the authentication request to Authelia. This time, Authelia can verify the user is authenticated and order the reverse proxy to let the query pass through. . Sequence Diagram . Here is a description of the complete workflow: . .",

This CLI provides many useful tools to help you during development. . In order to build and contribute to Authelia, you need to make sure Go v1.13, Docker, docker-compose and Node v12 are installed on your machine. . Get started . Authelia is made of Go application serving the API and a React application for the portal. . In order to ease development, Authelia uses the concept of suites to run Authelia from source code so that your patches are included. This is a kind of virtual environment running Authelia in a complete ecosystem (LDAP, Redis, SQL server). Note that Authelia is hotreloaded in the environment so that your patches are instantly included. . The next command starts the suite called Standalone: . $ authelia-scripts suites setup Standalone . Most of the suites are using docker-compose to bootstrap the environment. Therefore, you can check the logs of all application by running the following command on the component you want to monitor. . $ docker logs authelia_authelia-backend_1 -f . Then, edit the code and observe how Authelia is automatically reloaded. . Unit tests . To run the unit tests, run: . $ authelia-scripts unittest . Integration tests . Integration tests are located under the internal/suites directory and are based on Selenium. A suite is a combination of environment and tests. Executing a suite therefore means starting the environment, running the tests and tearing down the environment. Each step can be run independently: . # List the available suites $ authelia-scripts suites list Standalone DuoPush LDAP Traefik # Start the environment of Standalone suite. $ authelia-scripts suites setup Standalone # Run the tests related to the currently running suite. $ authelia-scripts suites test # Tear down the environment $ authelia-scripts suites teardown Standalone . In order to test all suites (approx 30 minutes), you need to make sure there is no currently running suite and then you should run: . $ authelia-scripts suites test . Also, you don’t need to start the suite before testing it. Given you’re not running any suite, just use the following command to test the Standalone suite. . $ authelia-scripts suites test Standalone . The suite will be spawned, tests will be run and then the suite will be teared down automatically. .",

NOTE: If not done already, we highly recommend you first follow the Getting Started documentation. . On Bare Metal . Authelia has been designed to be a proxy companion handling the authentication and authorization requests for your entire infrastructure. . As Authelia will be key to your architecture, it requires several components to make it highly-available. Deploying it in production means having an LDAP server for storing the information about the users, a Redis cache to store the user sessions in a distributed manner, a SQL server like MariaDB to persist user configurations and one or more nginx reverse proxies configured to be used with Authelia. With such a setup Authelia can easily be scaled to multiple instances to evenly handle the traffic. . NOTE: If you don’t have all those components, don’t worry, there is a way to deploy Authelia with only nginx. This is described in Deployment for Devs. . Here are the available steps to deploy Authelia given the configuration file is /path/to/your/configuration.yml. Note that you can create your own configuration file from config.template.yml located at the root of the repo. .

In the case of Traefik, those headers are automatically provided and therefore don’t appear in the configuration examples. . Redirection to the login portal . The endpoint /api/verify has different behaviors depending on whether the rd (for redirection) query parameter is provided. . If redirection parameter is provided and contains the URL to the login portal served by Authelia, the request will either generate a 200 response if the request is authenticated or perform a redirection (302 response) to the login portal if not authenticated yet. . If no redirection parameter is provided, the response code is either 200 or 401. The redirection must then be handled by the proxy when an error is detected (see nginx example). .",

    "title": "Security Measures",
    "content": "Security Measures . Protection against cookie theft . Authelia uses two mechanisms to protect against cookie theft: . session attribute httpOnly set to true make client-side code unable to read the cookie. | session attribute secure ensure the cookie will never be sent over an insecure HTTP connections. | Protection against multi-domain cookie attacks . Since Authelia uses multi-domain cookies to perform single sign-on, an attacker who poisoned a user’s DNS cache can easily retrieve the user’s cookies by making the user send a request to one of the attacker’s IPs. . To mitigate this risk, it’s advisable to only use HTTPS connections with valid certificates and enforce it with HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) so that the attacker must also require the certificate to retrieve the cookies. . Note that using HSTS has consequences. That’s why you should read the blog post nginx has written on HSTS. . Notifier security measures (SMTP) . By default the SMTP Notifier implementation does not allow connections that are not secure. As such all connections require the following: . TLS Connection (STARTTLS or SMTPS) has been negotiated before authentication or sending emails (unauthenticated connections require it as well) | Valid X509 Certificate presented to the client during the TLS handshake | There is an option to disable both of these security measures however they are not recommended. You should only do this in a situation where you control all networks between Authelia and the SMTP server. The following configuration options exist to configure the security level: . SMTPS vs STARTTLS . By default all connections start as plain text and are upgraded via STARTTLS. SMTPS is supported, however due to the fact it was basically considered deprecated before the turn of the century, there is no way to configure it. It happens automatically when a SMTP notifier is configured with the SMTPS port of 465. . Configuration Option: disable_verify_cert . This is a YAML boolean type (true/false, y/n, 1/0, etc). This disables the X509 PKI verification mechanism. We recommend using the trusted_cert option over this, as disabling this security feature makes you vulnerable to MITM attacks. . Configuration Option: disable_require_tls . This is a YAML boolean type (true/false, y/n, 1/0, etc). This disables the requirement that all connections must be over TLS. This is only usable currently with authentication disabled (comment the password) and as such is only an option for SMTP servers that allow unauthenticated relay (bad practice). . Configuration Option: trusted_cert . This is a YAML string type. This specifies the file location of a pub certificate that can be used to validate the authenticity of a server with a self signed certificate. This can either be the public cert of the certificate authority used to sign the certificate or the public key itself. They must be in the PEM format. The certificate is added in addition to the certificates trusted by the host machine. If the certificate is invalid, inaccessible, or is otherwise not configured; Authelia just uses the hosts certificates. . Explanation . There are a few reasons for the security measures implemented: . Transmitting username’s and passwords over plain-text is an obvious vulnerability | The emails generated by Authelia, if transmitted in plain-text could allow an attacker to intercept a link used to setup 2FA; which reduces security | Not validating the identity of the server allows man-in-the-middle attacks | More protections measures with Nginx . You can also apply the following headers to your nginx configuration for improving security. Please read the documentation of those headers before applying them blindly. . # We don&#39;t want any credentials / TOTP secret key / QR code to be cached by # the client add_header Cache-Control &quot;no-store&quot;; add_header Pragma &quot;no-cache&quot;; # Clickjacking / XSS protection # We don&#39;t want Authelia&#39;s login page to be rendered within a &lt;frame&gt;, # &lt;iframe&gt; or &lt;object&gt; from an external website. add_header X-Frame-Options &quot;SAMEORIGIN&quot;; # Block pages from loading when they detect reflected XSS attacks. add_header X-XSS-Protection &quot;1; mode=block&quot;; .",

Run tests of running suite . If a suite is already running, you can simply type the test command that will run the test related to the currently running suite: . $ authelia-scripts suites test . Run tests of non-running suite . However, if no suite is running yet and you just want to run the tests of a specific suite like HighAvailability, you can do so with the next command: . # Set up the env, run the tests and tear down the env $ authelia-scripts suites test HighAvailability . Run all tests of all suites . Running all tests is easy. Make sure that no suite is already running and run: . authelia-scripts suites test . Run tests in headless mode . As you might have noticed, the tests are run using chromedriver and selenium. It means that the tests open an instance of Chrome that might interfere with your other activities.
