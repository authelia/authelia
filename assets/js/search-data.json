It is recommended that this is configured to deny for security reasons. Sites which you do not wish to secure at all with Authelia should not be configured in your reverse proxy to perform authentication with Authelia at all for performance reasons. See Policies for more information. networks (global) . type: list . required: no . The main/global networks section contains a list of networks with a name label that can be reused in the rules section instead of redefining the same networks over and over again. This additionally makes complicated network related configuration a lot cleaner and easier to read. This section has two options, name and networks. Where the networks section is a list of IP addresses in CIDR notation and where name is a friendly name to label the collection of networks for reuse in the networks section of the rules section below. This configuration option does nothing by itself, it’s only useful if you use these aliases in the rules section below. rules . type: list . required: no . The rules have many configuration options. A rule matches when all criteria of the rule match the request excluding the policy which is the policy applied to the request. A rule defines two primary things: . | the policy applied when all criteria match. | the matching criteria of the request presented to the reverse proxy . | . The criteria is broken into several parts: . | domain: domain or list of domains targeted by the request. | resources: pattern or list of patterns that the path should match. | subject: the user or group of users to define the policy for. | networks: the network addresses, ranges (CIDR notation) or groups from where the request originates. | methods: the http methods used in the request. | . A rule is matched when all criteria of the rule match. Rules are evaluated in sequential order, and the first rule that is a match for a given request is the rule applied; subsequent rules have no effect. This is particularly important for bypass rules. Bypass rules should generally appear near the top of the rules list. However you need to carefully evaluate your rule list in order to see which rule matches a particular scenario. A comprehensive understanding of how rules apply is also recommended. policy . type: string . required: yes . The specific policy to apply to the selected rule. This is not criteria for a match, this is the action to take when a match is made. domain . type: list(string) . required: yes . This criteria matches the domain name and has two methods of configuration, either as a single string or as a list of strings. When it’s a list of strings the rule matches when any of the domains in the list match the request domain. Rules may start with a few different wildcards: . | The standard wildcard is *., which when in front of a domain means that any subdomain is effectively a match. For example *.example.com would match abc.example.com and secure.example.com. When using a wildcard like this the string must be quoted like \"*.example.com\". | The user wildcard is {user}., which when in front of a domain dynamically matches the username of the user. For example {user}.example.com would match fred.example.com if the user logged in was named fred. Note: we’re considering refactoring this to just be regex which would likely allow many additional possibilities. | The group wildcard is {group}., which when in front of a domain dynamically matches if the logged in user has the group in that location. For example {group}.example.com would match admins.example.com if the user logged in was in the following groups admins,users,people because admins is in the list. | . Domains in this section must be the domain configured in the session configuration or subdomains of that domain. This is because a website can only write cookies for a domain it is part of. It is theoretically possible for us to do this with multiple domains however we would have to be security conscious in our implementation, and it is not currently a priority. Examples: . Single domain of *.example.com matched. All rules in this list are effectively the same rule just expressed in different ways. access_control: rules: - domain: \"*.example.com\" policy: bypass - domain: - \"*.example.com\" policy: bypass . Multiple domains matched. These rules would match either apple.example.com or orange.example.com. All rules in this list are effectively the same rule just expressed in different ways. access_control: rules: - domain: [\"apple.example.com\", \"banana.example.com\"] policy: bypass - domain: - apple.example.com - banana.example.com policy: bypass . subject . type: list(list(string)) . required: no . Note: this rule criteria may not be used for the bypass policy the minimum required authentication level to identify the subject is one_factor. We have taken an opinionated stance on preventing this configuration as it could result in problematic security scenarios with badly thought out configurations and cannot see a likely configuration scenario that would require users to do this. If you have a scenario in mind please open an issue on GitHub. This criteria matches identifying characteristics about the subject. Currently this is either user or groups the user belongs to. This allows you to effectively control exactly what each user is authorized to access or to specifically require two-factor authentication to specific users. Subjects are prefixed with either user: or group: to identify which part of the identity to check. The format of this rule is unique in as much as it is a list of lists. The logic behind this format is to allow for both OR and AND logic. The first level of the list defines the OR logic, and the second level defines the AND logic. Additionally each level of these lists does not have to be explicitly defined. Example: . Matches when the user has the username john, or the user is in the groups admin and app-name, or the user is in the group super-admin. All rules in this list are effectively the same rule just expressed in different ways. access_control: rules: - domain: example.com policy: two_factor subject: - \"user:john\" - [\"group:admin\", \"group:app-name\"] - \"group:super-admin\" - domain: example.com policy: two_factor subject: - [\"user:john\"] - [\"group:admin\", \"group:app-name\"] - [\"group:super-admin\"] . Matches when the user is in the super-admin group. All rules in this list are effectively the same rule just expressed in different ways. access_control: rules: - domain: example.com policy: one_factor subject: \"group:super-admin\" - domain: example.com policy: one_factor subject: - \"group:super-admin\" - domain: example.com policy: one_factor subject: - [\"group:super-admin\"] . methods . type: list(string) . required: no . This criteria matches the HTTP request method. This is primarily useful when trying to bypass authentication for specific request types when those requests would prevent essential or public operation of the website. An example is when you need to do CORS preflight requests you could apply the bypass policy to OPTIONS requests. It’s important to note that Authelia cannot preserve request data when redirecting the user. For example if the user had permission to do GET requests, their authentication level was one_factor, and POST requests required them to do two_factor authentication, they would lose the form data. Additionally it is sometimes not possible to redirect users who have done requests other than HEAD or GET which means the user experience may suffer. These are the reasons it’s only recommended to use this to increase security where essential and for CORS preflight. Example: . access_control: rules: - domain: example.com policy: bypass methods: - OPTIONS . The valid request methods are: OPTIONS, HEAD, GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE, TRACE, CONNECT. Additional information about HTTP request methods can be found on the MDN. networks . type: list(string) . required: no . This criteria is a list of values which can be an IP Address, network address range in CIDR notation, or an alias from the global section. It matches against the first address in the X-Forwarded-For header, or if there are none it will fall back to the IP address of the packet TCP source IP address. For this reason it’s important for you to configure the proxy server correctly in order to accurately match requests with this criteria. Note: you may combine CIDR networks with the alias rules as you please. The main use case for this criteria is adjust the security requirements of a resource based on the location of a user. You can theoretically consider a specific network to be one of the factors involved in authentiation, you can deny specific networks, etc. For example if you have an application exposed on both the local networks and the external networks, you are able to distinguish between those requests and apply differing policies to each. Either denying access when the user is on the external networks and allowing specific external clients to access it as well as internal clients, or by requiring less privileges when a user is on the local networks. There are a large number of scenarios regarding networks and the order of the rules. This provides a lot of flexibility for administrators to tune the security to their specific needs if desired. Examples: . Require two_factor for all clients other than internal clients and 112.134.145.167. The first two rules in this list are effectively the same rule just expressed in different ways. access_control: default_policy: two_factor networks: - name: internal networks: - 10.0.0.0/8 - 172.16.0.0/12 - 192.168.0.0/18 rules: - domain: secure.example.com policy: one_factor networks: - 10.0.0.0/8 - 172.16.0.0/12 - 192.168.0.0/18 - 112.134.145.167/32 - domain: secure.example.com policy: one_factor networks: - internal - 112.134.145.167/32 - domain: secure.example.com policy: two_factor . resources . type: list(string) . required: no . This criteria matches the path and query of the request using regular expressions. The rule is expressed as a list of strings. If any one of the regular expressions in the list matches the request it’s considered a match. A useful tool for debugging these regular expressions is called Rego. Note: Prior to 4.27.0 the regular expressions only matched the path excluding the query parameters. After 4.27.0 they match the entire path including the query parameters. When upgrading you may be required to alter some of your resource rules to get them to operate as they previously did. It’s important when configuring resource rules that you enclose them in quotes otherwise you may run into some issues with escaping the expressions. Failure to do so may prevent Authelia from starting. It’s technically optional but will likely save you a lot of time if you do it for all resource rules. Examples: . Applies the bypass policy when the domain is app.example.com and the url is /api, or starts with either /api/ or /api?. access_control: rules: - domain: app.example.com policy: bypass resources: - \"^/api([/?].*)?$\" .

You should setup the domain you intend to protect with Authelia to point to your external IP address and port forward ports 80 and 443 to the host you plan to host the docker-compose.yml bundle. Port 80 is utilised by LetsEncrypt for certificate challenges, this will automatically provision up-to-date certificates for your domain(s).

The provided examples protect the Traefik dashboard with Authelia’s one-factor auth (traefik.example.com) and two instances of the whoami container with Authelia being bypassed (public.example.com) and another with it’s two-factor auth (secure.example.com).

Password hash algorithm . The default hash algorithm is Argon2id version 19 with a salt. Argon2id is currently considered the best hashing algorithm, and in 2015 won the Password Hashing Competition. It benefits from customizable parameters allowing the cost of computing a hash to scale into the future which makes it harder to brute-force. Argon2id was implemented due to community feedback as you can see in this closed issue. For backwards compatibility and user choice support for the SHA512 algorithm is still available. While it’s a reasonable hashing function given high enough iterations, as hardware improves it has a higher chance of being brute-forced. Hashes are identifiable as argon2id or SHA512 by their prefix of either $argon2id$ and $6$ respectively, as described in this wiki page. Important Note: When using argon2id Authelia will appear to remain using the memory allocated to creating the hash. This is due to how Go allocates memory to the heap when generating an argon2id hash. Go periodically garbage collects the heap, however this doesn’t remove the memory allocation, it keeps it allocated even though it’s technically unused. Under memory pressure the unused allocated memory will be reclaimed by the operating system, you can test this on linux with: . $ stress-ng --vm-bytes $(awk '/MemFree/{printf \"%d\\n\", $2 * 0.9;}' &lt; /proc/meminfo)k --vm-keep -m 1 . If this is not desirable we recommend investigating the following options in order of most to least secure: . | using the LDAP authentication provider | adjusting the memory parameter | changing the algorithm | . Password hash algorithm tuning . All algorithm tuning for Argon2id is supported. The only configuration variables that affect SHA512 are iterations and salt length. The configuration variables are unique to the file authentication provider, thus they all exist in a key under the file authentication configuration key called password. We have set what are considered as sane and recommended defaults to cater for a reasonable system, if you’re unsure about which settings to tune, please see the parameters below, or for a more in depth understanding see the referenced documentation in Argon2 links. Examples for specific systems . These examples have been tested against a single system to make sure they roughly take 0.5 seconds each. Your results may vary depending on individual specification and utilization, but they are a good guide to get started. You should however read the linked documents in Argon2 links. | System | Iterations | Parallelism | Memory | . | Raspberry Pi 2 | 1 | 8 | 64 | . | Raspberry Pi 3 | 1 | 8 | 128 | . | Raspberry Pi 4 | 1 | 8 | 128 | . | Intel G5 i5 NUC | 1 | 8 | 1024 | .

Secure Authelia with TLS . There is a known limitation with haproxy-auth-request with regard to TLS-enabled backends. If you want to run Authelia TLS enabled the recommended workaround utilises HAProxy itself to proxy the requests. This comes at a cost of two additional TCP connections, but allows the full HAProxy configuration flexibility with regard to TLS verification as well as header rewriting.

Those headers are returned by Authelia on requests to /api/verify and must be forwarded by the reverse proxy to the backends needing them. The headers will be provided with each call to the backend once the user is authenticated. Please note that the backend must support the use of those headers to leverage that information, many backends still don’t (and probably won’t) support it. However, we are working on solving this issue with OpenID Connect/OAuth2 which is a widely adopted open standard for access delegation. So, if you’re developing your own application, you can read those headers and use them. If you don’t own the codebase of the backend, you need to check whether it supports this type of authentication or not. If it does not, you have three options: . | Enable authentication on the backend and make your users authenticate twice (not user-friendly). | Completely disable the authentication of your backend. This works only if all your users share the same privileges in the backend. | Many applications support OAuth2 so the last option would be to just wait for Authelia to be an OpenID Connect provider (https://github.com/authelia/authelia/issues/189). | .

The random interval of time is anything between 0 milliseconds and 85 milliseconds. When Authelia first starts it assumes the last 10 attempts took 1000 milliseconds each. As users login successfully it quickly adjusts to the actual time the login attempts take. This process is independent of the login backend you have configured. The cost of this is low since in the instance of a user not existing it just stops processing the request to delay the login. Lastly the absolute minimum time authentication can take is 250 milliseconds. Both of these measures also have the added effect of creating an additional delay for all authentication attempts increasing the time that a brute-force attack will take, this combined with regulation greatly delays brute-force attacks and the effectiveness of them in general.

First and foremost Authelia only uses very secure hashing algorithms with sane and secure defaults. The first and default hashing algorithm we use is Argon2id which is currently considered the most secure hashing algorithm. We also support SHA512, which previously was the default. Secondly Authelia uses salting with all hashing algorithms. These salts are generated with a random string generator, which is seeded every time it’s used by a cryptographically secure 1024bit prime number. This ensures that even if an attacker obtains the file, each password has to be brute forced individually. Lastly Authelia’s implementation of Argon2id is highly tunable. You can tune the key length, salt used, iterations (time), parallelism, and memory usage. To read more about this please read how to configure file authentication. ",

Additionally, it will invalidate any session where the user could not be retrieved from LDAP based on the user filter, for example if they were deleted or disabled provided the user filter is set correctly. These updates occur when a user accesses a resource protected by Authelia. This means you should ensure disabled users or users with expired passwords are not obtainable using the LDAP filter, the default filter for Active Directory implements this behaviour.

    "content": "The SMTP Notifier implementation does not allow connections that are not secure without changing default configuration values. As such all SMTP connections require the following: . | TLS Connection (STARTTLS or SMTPS) has been negotiated before authentication or sending emails (unauthenticated connections require it as well) | Valid X509 Certificate presented to the client during the TLS handshake | . There is an option to disable both of these security measures however they are not recommended. The following configuration options exist to configure the security level in order of most preferable to least preferable: . Configuration Option: certificates_directory . You can configure a directory of certificates for Authelia to trust. These certificates can either be CA’s or individual public certificates that should be trusted. These are added in addition to the environments PKI trusted certificates if available. This is useful for trusting a certificate that is self-signed without drastically reducing security. This is the most recommended workaround to not having a valid PKI trusted certificate as it gives you complete control over which ones are trusted without disabling critically needed validation of the identity of the target service. Read more in the documentation for this option. Configuration Option: tls.skip_verify . The tls.skip_verify option allows you to skip verifying the certificate entirely which is why certificates_directory is preferred over this. This will effectively mean you cannot be sure the certificate is valid which means an attacker via DNS poisoning or MITM attacks could intercept emails from Authelia compromising a user’s security without their knowledge. Configuration Option: disable_require_tls . Authelia by default ensures that the SMTP server connection is secured via STARTTLS or SMTPS prior to sending sensitive information. The disable_require_tls disables this requirement which means the emails are sent in plain text. This is the least secure option as it effectively removes the validation of SMTP certificates and removes the encryption offered by the STARTTLS/SMTPS connection all together. This means not only can the vulnerabilities of the skip_verify option be exploited, but any router or switch along the route of the email which receives the packets could be used to silently exploit the plain text nature of the email. This is only usable currently with authentication disabled (comment out the password) and as such is only an option for SMTP servers that allow unauthenticated relay (bad practice). SMTPS vs STARTTLS . All connections start as plain text and are upgraded via STARTTLS. SMTPS is an exception to this rule where the connection is over TLS. As SMTPS is deprecated, the only way to configure this is to set the SMTP port to the officially recognized SMTPS port of 465 which will cause Authelia to automatically consider it to be a SMTPS connection. As such your SMTP server, if not offering SMTPS, should not be listening on port 465 which is bad practice anyway. ",

    "content": "Reset Password . It’s possible to disable the reset password functionality and is an optional adjustment to consider for anyone wanting to increase security. See the configuration for more information. Session security . We have a few options to configure the security of a session. The main and most important one is the session secret. This is used to encrypt the session data when it is stored in the Redis key value database. The value of this option should be long and as random as possible. See more in the documentation for this option. The validity period of session is highly configurable. For example in a highly security conscious domain you could set the session remember_me_duration to 0 to disable this feature, and set the expiration to 2 hours and the inactivity of 10 minutes. Configuring the session security in this manner would mean if the cookie age was more than 2 hours or if the user was inactive for more than 10 minutes the session would be destroyed. Additional proxy protection measures . You can also apply the following headers to your proxy configuration for improving security. Please read the relevant documentation for these headers before applying them blindly. nginx . # We don't want any credentials / TOTP secret key / QR code to be cached by # the client add_header Cache-Control \"no-store\"; add_header Pragma \"no-cache\"; # Clickjacking / XSS protection # We don't want Authelia's login page to be rendered within a &lt;frame&gt;, # &lt;iframe&gt; or &lt;object&gt; from an external website. add_header X-Frame-Options \"SAMEORIGIN\"; # Block pages from loading when they detect reflected XSS attacks. add_header X-XSS-Protection \"1; mode=block\"; .

More protections measures with fail2ban . If you are running fail2ban, adding a filter and jail for Authelia can reduce load on the application / web server. Fail2ban will ban IPs exceeding a threshold of repeated failed logins at the firewall level of your host. If you are using Docker, the Authelia log file location has to be mounted from the host system to the container for fail2ban to access it. Create a configuration file in the filter.d folder with the content below. In Debian-based systems the folder is typically located at /etc/fail2ban/filter.d. # Fail2Ban filter for Authelia # Make sure that the HTTP header \"X-Forwarded-For\" received by Authelia's backend # only contains a single IP address (the one from the end-user), and not the proxy chain # (it is misleading: usually, this is the purpose of this header). # the failregex rule counts every failed login (wrong username or password) and failed TOTP entry as a failure # the ignoreregex rule ignores debug, info and warning messages as all authentication failures are flagged as errors [Definition] failregex = ^.*Error while checking password for.*remote_ip=&lt;HOST&gt; stack.* ^.*Credentials are wrong for user .*remote_ip=&lt;HOST&gt; stack.* ^.*Wrong passcode during TOTP validation.*remote_ip=&lt;HOST&gt; stack.* ignoreregex = ^.*level=debug.* ^.*level=info.* ^.*level=warning.* . Modify the jail.local file. In Debian-based systems the folder is typically located at /etc/fail2ban/. If the file does not exist, create it by copying the jail.conf cp /etc/fail2ban/jail.conf /etc/fail2ban/jail.local. Add an Authelia entry to the “Jails” section of the file: . [authelia] enabled = true port = http,https,9091 filter = authelia logpath = /path-to-your-authelia.log maxretry = 3 bantime = 1d findtime = 1d chain = DOCKER-USER . If you are not using Docker remove the line “chain = DOCKER-USER”. You will need to restart the fail2ban service for the changes to take effect. ",

    "content": "Authelia will run as the root user and group by default, there are two options available to run as a non-root user and group. It is recommended which ever approach you take that to secure the sensitive files Authelia requires access to that you make sure the chmod of the files does not inadvertently allow read access to the files by users who do not need access to them. Examples: . If you wanted to run Authelia as UID 8000, and wanted the GID of 9000 to also have read access to the files you might do the following assuming the files were in the relative path .data/authelia: . chown -r 8000:9000 .data/authelia find .data/authelia/ -type d -exec chmod 750 {} \\; find .data/authelia/ -type f -exec chmod 640 {} \\; . If you wanted to run Authelia as UID 8000, and wanted the GID of 9000 to also have write access to the files you might do the following assuming the files were in the relative path .data/authelia: . chown -r 8000:9000 .data/authelia find .data/authelia/ -type d -exec chmod 770 {} \\; find .data/authelia/ -type f -exec chmod 660 {} \\; . Docker user directive . The docker user directive allows you to configure the user the entrypoint runs as. This is generally the most secure option for containers as no process accessible to the container ever runs as root which prevents a compromised container from exploiting unnecessary privileges. The directive can either be applied in your docker run command using the --user argument or by the docker-compose user: key. The examples below assume you’d like to run the container as UID 8000 and GID 9000. Example for the docker CLI: . docker run --user 8000:9000 -v /authelia:/config authelia/authelia:latest . Example for docker-compose: . version: '3.8' services: authelia: image: authelia/authelia container_name: authelia user: 8000:9000 volumes: - ./authelia:/config . Running the container in this way requires that you manually adjust the file owner at the very least as described above. If you do not do so it will likely cause Authelia to exit immediately. This option takes precedence over the PUID and PGID environment variables below, so if you use it then changing the PUID and PGID have zero effect. PUID/PGID environment variables using the entrypoint . The second option is to use the PUID and PGID environment variables. When the container entrypoint is executed as root, the entrypoint automatically runs the Authelia process as this user. An added benefit of using the environment variables is the mounted volumes ownership will automatically be changed for you. It is still recommended that you run the find chmod examples above in order to secure the files even further especially on servers multiple people have access to. The examples below assume you’d like to run the container as UID 8000 and GID 9000. Example for the docker CLI: . docker run -e PUID=1000 -e PGID=1000 -v /authelia:/config authelia/authelia:latest . Example for docker-compose: . version: '3.8' services: authelia: image: authelia/authelia container_name: authelia environment: PUID: 1000 PGID: 1000 volumes: - ./authelia:/config . ",

    "content": "We have decided to implement OpenID Connect as a beta feature, it’s suggested you only utilize it for testing and providing feedback, and should take caution in relying on it in production as of now. OpenID Connect and it’s related endpoints are not enabled by default unless you specifically configure the OpenID Connect section. The beta will be broken up into stages. Each stage will bring additional features. The following table is a rough plan for which stage will have each feature, and may evolve over time: . | Stage | Feature Description | . | beta1 | User Consent | . | Authorization Code Flow | . | OpenID Connect Discovery | . | RS256 Signature Strategy | . | Per Client Scope/Grant Type/Response Type Restriction | . | Per Client Authorization Policy (1FA/2FA) | . | Per Client List of Valid Redirection URI's | . | beta2 1 | Userinfo Endpoint (missed in beta1) | . | beta3 1 | Token Storage | . | Audit Storage | . | beta4 1 | Back-Channel Logout | . | Deny Refresh on Session Expiration | . | Signing Key Rotation Policy | . | Client Secrets Hashed in Configuration | . | GA 1 | General Availability after previous stages are vetted for bug fixes | . | misc | List of other features that may be implemented | . | Front-Channel Logout 2 | . ¹ This stage has not been implemented as of yet. ² This individual feature has not been implemented as of yet.

The private key in DER base64 encoded PEM format used to encrypt the OpenID Connect JWT’s.¹ You must generate this option yourself. To create this option, use docker run -u \"$(id -u):$(id -g)\" -v \"$(pwd)\":/keys authelia/authelia:latest authelia rsa generate --dir /keys to generate both the private and public key in the current directory. You can then paste the private key into your configuration. Should be defined using a secret which is the recommended for containerized deployments. access_token_lifespan . type: duration . default: 1h . required: no . The maximum lifetime of an access token. It’s generally recommended keeping this short similar to the default. For more information read these docs about token lifespan. authorize_code_lifespan . type: duration . default: 1m . required: no . The maximum lifetime of an authorize code. This can be rather short, as the authorize code should only be needed to obtain the other token types. For more information read these docs about token lifespan. id_token_lifespan . type: duration . default: 1h . required: no . The maximum lifetime of an ID token. For more information read these docs about token lifespan. refresh_token_lifespan . type: string . default: 30d . required: no . The maximum lifetime of a refresh token. The refresh token can be used to obtain new refresh tokens as well as access tokens or id tokens with an up-to-date expiration. For more information read these docs about token lifespan. enable_client_debug_messages . type: boolean . default: false . required: no . Allows additional debug messages to be sent to the clients. minimum_parameter_entropy . type: integer . default: 8 . required: no . This controls the minimum length of the nonce and state parameters. Security Notice: Changing this value is generally discouraged, reducing it from the default can theoretically make certain scenarios less secure. It is highly encouraged that if your OpenID Connect RP does not send these parameters or sends parameters with a lower length than the default that they implement a change rather than changing this value. clients . A list of clients to configure. The options for each client are described below. id . type: string . required: yes . The Client ID for this client. It must exactly match the Client ID configured in the application consuming this client. description . type: string . default: same as id . required: no . A friendly description for this client shown in the UI. This defaults to the same as the ID. secret . type: string . required: yes . The shared secret between Authelia and the application consuming this client. This secret must match the secret configured in the application. Currently this is stored in plain text. You must generate this option yourself. authorization_policy . type: string . default: two_factor . required: no . The authorization policy for this client: either one_factor or two_factor. redirect_uris . type: list(string) . required: yes . A list of valid callback URL´s this client will redirect to. All other callbacks will be considered unsafe. The URL’s are case-sensitive and they differ from application to application - the community has provided a list of URL´s for common applications. scopes . type: list(string) . default: openid, groups, profile, email . required: no . A list of scopes to allow this client to consume. See scope definitions for more information. The documentation for the application you want to use with Authelia will most-likely provide you with the scopes to allow. grant_types . type: list(string) . default: refresh_token, authorization_code . required: no . A list of grant types this client can return. It is recommended that this isn’t configured at this time unless you know what you’re doing.

If you’re willing to contribute and help us move forward faster, get in touch with us on Matrix. We’ll be glad to share ideas and plans with you. Below are the prioritised roadmap items: . | In Preview this roadmap item is in preview status, more information can be found in the docs. Authelia acts as an OpenID Connect Provider. This is a high priority because currently the only way to pass authentication information back to the protected app is through the use of HTTP headers as described here however, many apps either do not support this method or are starting to move away from this in favour of OpenID Connect or OAuth2 internally or via plugins. | Administration interface. This is useful in many cases to properly manage users and administrate activities like unbanning banned users. In the future we can even think of adding/removing users from there, request a password reset for a user or all users, request a 2FA enrollment, temporarily block users, etc… . | User interface. This will help the users manage their 2FA devices, reset their password, review their authentication activity. In the future we envisage users will be able to customize their profile with an avatar, set their preferences regarding 2FA and according to the global policy defined by administrators, etc… . | Facilitate setup on Kubernetes. There are mainly two objectives here. First, we need to provide the documentation required to setup Authelia on Kubernetes. Even though, some users already have it working and the feature is even tested in the project, there is a clear lack of documentation. The second item is to provide a Helm chart to streamline the setup on Kubernetes. | . ",

This is unacceptable for the operation of Authelia and is thus not supported for high availability. Storage Provider . Severity: BREAKING. Solution: Use a session provider other than SQLite3 (MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL). Use of the local storage provider (SQLite3) is not supported in high availability setups due to a design limitation with how SQLite3 operates. Use any of the other storage providers. Notification Provider . Severity: HIGH. Solution: Use a notification provider other than file system (SMTP). Use of the file system notification provider prevents users from several key tasks which heavily impact usability of the system, and technically reduce security. Users will be unable to reset passwords or register new 2FA devices on their own. The file system provider is not supported for high availability. Authentication Provider . Severity: MEDIUM (limiting). Solution: Use an authentication provider other than file (LDAP), or distribute the file and disable password reset. Use of the file authentication provider (YAML) is only partially supported with high availability setups. It’s recommended if you don’t use a stateless provider that you disable password reset and make sure the file is distributed to all instances.

Sessions can have both soft and hard expiration time limits. With the soft limit, the user is logged out when inactive for a certain period of time. With the hard limit, the user has to authenticate again after a certain period of time, whether they were active or not. | Brute force attacks against credentials are protected thanks to a regulation mechanism temporarily blocking the user account after too many attempts and delays to the authentication process. | Identity validation is required for performing administrative actions such as registering 2FA devices, preventing attackers to pass two-factor authentication by self-registering their own device. An email with a link is sent to the user with a link providing them access to the registration flow which can only be opened by a single session. | Prevention against session fixation by regenerating a new session after each privilege elevation. | Prevention against LDAP injection by following OWASP recommendations regarding valid input characters. | Connections between Authelia and third-party components like the SMTP server, database, session cache, and LDAP server can be made over TLS to mitigate against man-in-the-middle attacks. | Validation of user group memberships gets refreshed regularly from the authentication backend (LDAP only). | .

These headers are transmitted unsigned to the backends, meaning a malicious user within the network could pretend to be Authelia and send those headers to bypass authentication and gain access to the service.
