  # Therefore, this backend is meant to be used in a dev environment
  # and not in production since it prevents Authelia to be scaled to
  # more than one instance. The options under password_options have sane
  # defaults, and as it has security implications it is highly recommended
  # you leave the default values. Before considering changing these settings

# Access Control
#
# Access control is a list of rules defining the authorizations applied for one
# resource to users or group of users.
#
# If 'access_control' is not defined, ACL rules are disabled and the 'bypass'
# rule is applied, i.e., access is allowed to anyone. Otherwise restrictions follow
# the rules defined.
#
# Note: One can use the wildcard * to match any subdomain.
# It must stand at the beginning of the pattern. (example: *.mydomain.com)
#
# Note: You must put patterns containing wildcards between simple quotes for the YAML
# to be syntactically correct.
#
# Definition: A 'rule' is an object with the following keys: 'domain', 'subject',
# 'policy' and 'resources'.
#
# - 'domain' defines which domain or set of domains the rule applies to.
#
# - 'subject' defines the subject to apply authorizations to. This parameter is
#    optional and matching any user if not provided. If provided, the parameter
#    represents either a user or a group. It should be of the form 'user:<username>'
#    or 'group:<groupname>'.
#
# - 'policy' is the policy to apply to resources. It must be either 'bypass',
#   'one_factor', 'two_factor' or 'deny'.
#
# - 'resources' is a list of regular expressions that matches a set of resources to
#    apply the policy to. This parameter is optional and matches any resource if not
#    provided.
#
# Note: the order of the rules is important. The first policy matching
# (domain, resource, subject) applies.
access_control:
  # Default policy can either be 'bypass', 'one_factor', 'two_factor' or 'deny'.
  # It is the policy applied to any resource if there is no policy to be applied
  # to the user.

# Configuration of the notification system.
#
# Notifications are sent to users when they require a password reset, a u2f

# Use only an available configuration: filesystem, gmail
notifier:
  # For testing purpose, notifications can be sent in a file
  ## filesystem:
  ##   filename: /tmp/authelia/notification.txt

  # Use a SMTP server for sending notifications. Authelia uses PLAIN or LOGIN method to authenticate.
  # [Security] By default Authelia will:
  #   - force all SMTP connections over TLS including unauthenticated connections
  #      - use the disable_require_tls boolean value to disable this requirement (only works for unauthenticated connections)
  #   - validate the SMTP server x509 certificate during the TLS handshake against the hosts trusted certificates
  #     - trusted_cert option:
  #       - this is a string value, that may specify the path of a PEM format cert, it is completely optional
  #       - if it is not set, a blank string, or an invalid path; will still trust the host machine/containers cert store
  #     - defaults to the host machine (or docker container's) trusted certificate chain for validation
  #     - use the trusted_cert string value to specify the path of a PEM format public cert to trust in addition to the hosts trusted certificates
  #     - use the disable_verify_cert boolean value to disable the validation (prefer the trusted_cert option as it's more secure)
