#
# There are two supported backends: `ldap` and `file`.

  # This backend allows Authelia to be scaled to more
  # than one instance and therefore is recommended for

  # File backend configuration.
  #
  # With this backend, the users database is stored in a file

  # Therefore, this backend is meant to be used in a dev environment

  # more than one instance.

# Access Control
#
# Access control is a list of rules defining the authorizations applied for one
# resource to users or group of users.
#
# If 'access_control' is not defined, ACL rules are disabled and the `bypass`
# rule is applied, i.e., access is allowed to anyone. Otherwise restrictions follow
# the rules defined.
#
# Note: One can use the wildcard * to match any subdomain.
# It must stand at the beginning of the pattern. (example: *.mydomain.com)
#
# Note: You must put patterns containing wildcards between simple quotes for the YAML
# to be syntactically correct.
#
# Definition: A `rule` is an object with the following keys: `domain`, `subject`,
# `policy` and `resources`.
#
# - `domain` defines which domain or set of domains the rule applies to.
#
# - `subject` defines the subject to apply authorizations to. This parameter is
#    optional and matching any user if not provided. If provided, the parameter
#    represents either a user or a group. It should be of the form 'user:<username>'
#    or 'group:<groupname>'.
#
# - `policy` is the policy to apply to resources. It must be either `bypass`,
#   `one_factor`, `two_factor` or `deny`.
#
# - `resources` is a list of regular expressions that matches a set of resources to
#    apply the policy to. This parameter is optional and matches any resource if not
#    provided.
#
# Note: the order of the rules is important. The first policy matching
# (domain, resource, subject) applies.
access_control:
  # Default policy can either be `bypass`, `one_factor`, `two_factor` or `deny`.
  # It is the policy applied to any resource if there is no policy to be applied
  # to the user.
  default_policy: deny

# Configuration of the authentication regulation mechanism.
#
# This mechanism prevents attackers from brute forcing the first factor.
# It bans the user if too many attempts are done in a short period of
# time.
regulation:
  # The number of failed login attempts before user is banned.
  # Set it to 0 to disable regulation.
  max_retries: 3

  # The time range during which the user can attempt login before being banned.
  # The user is banned if the authentication failed `max_retries` times in a `find_time` seconds window.

# Configuration of the storage backend used to store data and secrets.

# Configuration of the notification system.
#
# Notifications are sent to users when they require a password reset, a u2f
# registration or a TOTP registration.
# Use only an available configuration: filesystem, gmail
notifier:
  # For testing purpose, notifications can be sent in a file
  ## filesystem:
  ##   filename: /tmp/authelia/notification.txt

  # Use a SMTP server for sending notifications. Authelia uses PLAIN or LOGIN method to authenticate.
  # [Security] By default Authelia will:
  #   - force all SMTP connections over TLS including unauthenticated connections
  #      - use the disable_require_tls boolean value to disable this requirement (only works for unauthenticated connections)
  #   - validate the SMTP server x509 certificate during the TLS handshake against the hosts trusted certificates
  #     - trusted_cert option:
  #       - this is a string value, that may specify the path of a PEM format cert, it is completely optional
  #       - if it is not set, a blank string, or an invalid path; will still trust the host machine/containers cert store
  #     - defaults to the host machine (or docker container's) trusted certificate chain for validation
  #     - use the trusted_cert string value to specify the path of a PEM format public cert to trust in addition to the hosts trusted certificates
  #     - use the disable_verify_cert boolean value to disable the validation (prefer the trusted_cert option as it's more secure)
