# Default redirection URL
#
# If user tries to authenticate without any referer, Authelia
# does not know where to redirect the user to at the end of the

# The authentication backend to use for verifying user passwords

#
# There are two supported backends: 'ldap' and 'file'.
authentication_backend:
  # Disable both the HTML element and the API for reset password functionality
  disable_reset_password: false

  # The amount of time to wait before we refresh data from the authentication backend. Uses duration notation.
  # To disable this feature set it to 'disable', this will slightly reduce security because for Authelia, users
  # will always belong to groups they belonged to at the time of login even if they have been removed from them in LDAP.
  # To force update on every request you can set this to '0' or 'always', this will increase processor demand.
  # See the below documentation for more information.

  # LDAP backend configuration.
  #
  # This backend allows Authelia to be scaled to more
  # than one instance and therefore is recommended for
  # production.
  ldap:
    # The url to the ldap server. Scheme can be ldap:// or ldaps://

    # The base dn for every entries
    base_dn: dc=example,dc=com
    
    # The attribute holding the username of the user. This attribute is used to populate
    # the username in the session information. It was introduced due to #561 to handle case
    # insensitive search queries.
    # For you information, Microsoft Active Directory usually uses 'sAMAccountName' and OpenLDAP
    # usually uses 'uid'
    # Beware that this attribute holds the unique identifiers for the users binding the user and the configuration
    # stored in database. Therefore only single value attributes are allowed and the value
    # must never be changed once attributed to a user otherwise it would break the configuration
    # for that user. Technically, non-unique attributes like 'mail' can also be used but we don't recommend using
    # them, we instead advise to use the attributes mentioned above (sAMAccountName and uid) to follow
    # https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2307.txt.
    username_attribute: uid
    
    # An additional dn to define the scope to all users
    additional_users_dn: ou=users

    # The users filter used in search queries to find the user profile based on input filled in login form.
    # Various placeholders are available to represent the user input and back reference other options of the configuration:
    # - {input} is a placeholder replaced by what the user inputs in the login form. 
    # - {username_attribute} is a placeholder replaced by what is configured in `username_attribute`.
    # - {mail_attribute} is a placeholder replaced by what is configured in `mail_attribute`.
    # - DON'T USE - {0} is an alias for {input} supported for backward compatibility but it will be deprecated in later versions, so please don't use it.
    #
    # Recommended settings are as follows:
    # - Microsoft Active Directory: (&({username_attribute}={input})(objectCategory=person)(objectClass=user))
    # - OpenLDAP: (&({username_attribute}={input})(objectClass=person))' or '(&({username_attribute}={input})(objectClass=inetOrgPerson))
    #
    # To allow sign in both with username and email, one can use a filter like
    # (&(|({username_attribute}={input})({mail_attribute}={input}))(objectClass=person))
    users_filter: (&({username_attribute}={input})(objectClass=person))

    # An additional dn to define the scope of groups
    additional_groups_dn: ou=groups
    
    # The groups filter used in search queries to find the groups of the user.
    # - {input} is a placeholder replaced by what the user inputs in the login form.
    # - {username} is a placeholder replace by the username stored in LDAP (based on `username_attribute`).
    # - {dn} is a matcher replaced by the user distinguished name, aka, user DN.
    # - {username_attribute} is a placeholder replaced by what is configured in `username_attribute`.
    # - {mail_attribute} is a placeholder replaced by what is configured in `mail_attribute`.
    # - DON'T USE - {0} is an alias for {input} supported for backward compatibility but it will be deprecated in later versions, so please don't use it.

    # The attribute holding the display name of the user. This will be used to greet an authenticated user.
    display_name_attribute: displayname

    # The username and password of the admin user.

  # File backend configuration.
  #
  # With this backend, the users database is stored in a file
  # which is updated when users reset their passwords.
  # Therefore, this backend is meant to be used in a dev environment
  # and not in production since it prevents Authelia to be scaled to
  # more than one instance. The options under 'password' have sane
  # defaults, and as it has security implications it is highly recommended
  # you leave the default values. Before considering changing these settings
  # please read the docs page below:

# Access Control
#
# Access control is a list of rules defining the authorizations applied for one
# resource to users or group of users.
#
# If 'access_control' is not defined, ACL rules are disabled and the 'bypass'
# rule is applied, i.e., access is allowed to anyone. Otherwise restrictions follow
# the rules defined.
#
# Note: One can use the wildcard * to match any subdomain.
# It must stand at the beginning of the pattern. (example: *.mydomain.com)
#
# Note: You must put patterns containing wildcards between simple quotes for the YAML
# to be syntactically correct.
#
# Definition: A 'rule' is an object with the following keys: 'domain', 'subject',
# 'policy' and 'resources'.
#
# - 'domain' defines which domain or set of domains the rule applies to.
#
# - 'subject' defines the subject to apply authorizations to. This parameter is
#    optional and matching any user if not provided. If provided, the parameter
#    represents either a user or a group. It should be of the form 'user:<username>'
#    or 'group:<groupname>'.
#
# - 'policy' is the policy to apply to resources. It must be either 'bypass',
#   'one_factor', 'two_factor' or 'deny'.
#
# - 'resources' is a list of regular expressions that matches a set of resources to
#    apply the policy to. This parameter is optional and matches any resource if not
#    provided.
#
# Note: the order of the rules is important. The first policy matching
# (domain, resource, subject) applies.
access_control:
  # Default policy can either be 'bypass', 'one_factor', 'two_factor' or 'deny'.
  # It is the policy applied to any resource if there is no policy to be applied
  # to the user.

  # [Security] By default Authelia will:
  #   - force all SMTP connections over TLS including unauthenticated connections

  #   - validate the SMTP server x509 certificate during the TLS handshake against the hosts trusted certificates
  #     - trusted_cert option:
  #       - this is a string value, that may specify the path of a PEM format cert, it is completely optional
  #       - if it is not set, a blank string, or an invalid path; will still trust the host machine/containers cert store
  #     - defaults to the host machine (or docker container's) trusted certificate chain for validation
  #     - use the trusted_cert string value to specify the path of a PEM format public cert to trust in addition to the hosts trusted certificates
  #     - use the disable_verify_cert boolean value to disable the validation (prefer the trusted_cert option as it's more secure)
