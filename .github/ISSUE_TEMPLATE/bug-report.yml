        Thanks for taking the time to fill out this bug report. If you are unsure if this is actually a bug and you still need some form of support we prefer and generally recommend creating a [Question and Answer Discussion](https://github.com/authelia/authelia/discussions/new?category=q-a) first.

        Please review the following requirements before submitting this issue type:

        1. Please ensure you do not report security vulnerabilities via this method. See our [Security Policy](https://www.authelia.com/security-policy).
        2. Please try to give as much information as possible for us to be able to reproduce the issue and provide a quick fix.
        3. Please ensure an issue does not already exist for this potential bug.
        4. Please only provide a released specific version or versions. Latest is not a version. Only released stable versions should be reported here; unreleased, untagged, or beta versions should have a report submitted via a [discussion](https://github.com/authelia/authelia/discussions/new/choose) instead.
        5. Please only report bugs with the Authelia application itself. Issues which match one of the following criteria should not be reported here (for the purpose of keeping the issue tracking clear and concise) but should be a [discussion](https://github.com/authelia/authelia/discussions/new/choose) instead:
            - Bugs with third-party software.
            - Mistakes in the documentation (which should be reported via the [Documentation Feedback](https://github.com/authelia/authelia/discussions/new?category=documentation-feedback) discussions).
            - Potential bugs where it is not somewhat clear that it's a bug with Authelia itself, a third party, or a misunderstanding/assumption about functionality.
        6. Please read the [Troubleshooting](https://www.authelia.com/r/troubleshooting) reference guide:
            - Do not truncate any logs unless you are complying with the specific instructions in the [Logs](https://www.authelia.com/r/troubleshooting#logs) section.
            - If you plan on sanitizing, removing, or adjusting any values for the logs or configuration files please read the [Sanitization](https://www.authelia.com/r/troubleshooting#sanitization) section.
        7. Please consider including a [HTTP Archive File](https://www.authelia.com/r/har) if you're having redirection issues.
